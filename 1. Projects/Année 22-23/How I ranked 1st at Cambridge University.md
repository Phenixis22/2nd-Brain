## <u>Target</u>
### <u>Scope the subject</u>
Create a sort of **tree diagram** that gives us a **visual representation** of everything we need to learn in the subject
That really help in terms of appreciating where stuff fits in
It's also possible to ==color code== the areas in which you're weak like a <mark class="hltr-red">Red</mark>/<mark class="hltr-yellow">Ambre</mark>/<mark class="hltr-green">Green</mark> system
Allows us to visionnate in **which categories we really neek to work on**
### <u>Focus on your weaknesses</u>
There is very easy temptation to focus on the things that we are good at.
The point of ==the color coding== system is that it really helps us **to target our specific weaknesses**
==You should give a ***disproportionnate*** amount of time on subject in which you know **you're suck** so that you can get to a point where **you're really good at all of the things**==
### <u>Use a retrospective revision timetable</u>
Different from a <u>prospective revision timetable</u> which is like "This day, I'm gonna study this and that. This day I'm gonna study this and that. Etc... etc..."
This is a **procrastination** exercise because just creating it is ==a waste of time aaand you never stick to it and obviously abandonned it==
Instead of planning what we gonna do in advance, we plan on the day what we gonna study and we again focus on our weaknesses. And then, at the end of the day, we can note down the date beside the subject we studied and color code it based on how well we did 
At the beginning, we have a list of subjects that are all <mark class="hltr-red">red</mark> and then slowly go <mark class="hltr-yellow">Amber</mark> and then slowly go <mark class="hltr-green">green</mark>

## <u>Revision</u>
### <u>Notetaking is a waste of time</u>
Simply taking notes kills your memory
It's not a very effective way to learn because it's quite passive and it's very easy for us to do
We should focusing on the more effective and efficient study techniques like the next one
### <u>Always understand first</u>
We shouldn't just try to memorise stuff and go along
We need to understand FIRST and then to memorize it
#### Understand it 
That means that we basically should be able to explain it to a 12 years old or a 5 years old
![[Einstein - quotes#^1]]
The feynman technique is that you should explain it to a five year old and if you found something you don't know, just dive in the texkbook and find the answer and understand it and then, try again to explain it to five year old
Then we have to Memorize it...
#### Memorize it
Three technique:
##### Active recall
We need to test ourselves
To memorize something, we have not to just only get it into our brain but also to retrieve it
Testing if by far the number one way to improve your score 
##### Space repetition
Whenever we learn anything, our memory exponentially decays, that is [[The forgetting curve]].
There is no evidence that anyone have a photographic memory. This is a myth.
Space repetition interrupts the forgetting curve
==So, we should study something on the day one, use active recall at the end of the session and then the next day we would repeat the testing exercice. If we have stuff wrong, we look at our notes then we might repeat it four days later, and then maybe a week later, etc... etc...==
Studying over a long periode of time is generally a lot better than random bouts of intensity all in one go because if you're doing 15min/day is better than 2hours in a day because you're benefiting from that space repetition
Memory formation really gets consolidated when we are sleeping and so in a way the more sleep you have in between study sessions, the more likely you're to more effortlessly retain all that stuff
##### Interleaving
Interleaving various different things in a single study session. this improve the performance of the session and so the retention of stuff. So generally, we want to interleaving things
## <u>Techniques</u>
### <u>Do lot of mock exams</u>
The exam is not a test of knowledge, it's a test of exam performance
When we are studying for a stuff, we should recognize that we are optimizing a score in a game and that game is the exam and mock exams are often the most high yield^[rendement] thing we can do. Because we are tapping in the whole active recall thing and tapping into the idea that testing ourselves is the just the way forward when it comes to memorizing
### <u>Do intentional flare</u>
The more flair you can add and the more you can stand out in their mind in a good way hopefully the more likely they are to give you a decent mark
The more you can make it look as if the sort of person who deserves a high mark, the more likely you are to get that high mark
### <u>Bank points with coursework</u>
Get the maximum points you can into the cousework^[contrôle continu si j'ai bien compris] because if a 100% of you notes is based on the final exam, it's quite pressureful
## <u>Friends</u>
### <u>Learn with friends</u>
Find a good group of friends motivated but not obviously on the same subject with the pomodoro technique. After the 25minutes of studying, you take a 5 minutes break to talk and discuss about what you've done or something else
This motivate more and make the whole thing more fun and creating memories
### <u>Test each other</u>
When someone study a topic, the other person are testing him about this topic.
Or something like, if Someone know something and Somebody want to learn this thing, Someone is going to ask questions to Somebody and fill the gaps when Somebody don't have the answer
### <u>Read your friends essays</u>
Get a system to share your essays with your friends and get their essays back
Beside, create differents essays, like this, it'll allows you to have access to like 10, 20 or 30 differents essays 
## <u>Balance</u>
### <u>Have a workspace</u>
In terms of focusing, have a specific space will help you
You should also have a routine, like an habit of working at the same hour, during the same amount of time, etc...
### <u>Have time to unwind</u>
It's all about balance
Schedule working by turning it as a game and scheduling time for unwinding 
### <u>Enjoy the journey and not so fixating on the destination</u>
Learning is a fun journey, a fun process
Enjoy each day, don't have in mind a sentence like "I will be happy when this or this..."
Enjoy along the way.
