# Be a gentleman
Some men have the most disgusting behaviors
You'll be respect only if you are a gentleman that came out of the rest of the society. If everyone have a shitty behavior, so you must be the one gentleman.

If you can't afford the bill, so don't go out with girls, put your head down and focus on your work.
