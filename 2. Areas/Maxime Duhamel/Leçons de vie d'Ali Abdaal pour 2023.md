###  **😓 1. Stop Pressing the Try Harder Button**

We all fall into the trap of thinking “I’ll just try harder next time” when we fail. But that approach isn’t usually effective.

Instead, it’s better to build a sustainable system for achieving our goals. That way, we won’t repeatedly fail or push yourself to burnout.

For example, if you’re a YouTuber and struggling to get your weekly video out on time, don’t just plan to work extra hours in the evening. Consider outsourcing your editing, making shorter videos, or replacing one video per month with a simple vlog.

Build a system that works for you.

### **🔋 2. Energisers vs Drainers**

Next time you have to choose between two options, ask yourself which one will drain you and which one will energise you. Then choose the option that’ll energise you.

Some examples might include:

-   Time with friends > Netflix
-   Evening gym sesh > morning gym sesh
-   Your dream work > soulless corporate job that pays twice as much.
​
###  **🛋️ 3. Choose to Be Satisfied**

Don’t beat yourself up at the end of the day for not getting enough done. You can just choose to be satisfied with what you did.

This might sound a bit wishy-washy, but it genuinely works. You can even say to yourself, _Well done [insert name here], you wrote 200 words today. Now it’s time to take a break._

Give yourself permission to switch off and get enough rest so that you can perform properly the next day.

###  **📆 4. Planning and Doing Are Different Modes of Being**

Planning is fundamentally different to doing, and both require a totally different headspace.

So, plan out what you’re going to do at the start of the day. Then for the rest of the day, simply execute on that plan. Never try to [plan and do](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/58hvh7h54ddkdoi7/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3RoZS1waWxvdC10aGUtcGxhbmUtdGhlLWVuZ2luZWVyLTI1ODMzMi8=) at the same time.

This is incredibly effective and works on a macro level as well. In 2022, my weeks where I planned everything in advance were much smoother and more productive.

###  **🌅 5. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day**

One of the best hacks for improving your sleep quality (and overall quality of life) is to wake up at the same time every day.

Choose a waking time like 7 or 7:30 that’ll let you get plenty of morning sunlight. Listening to the [Huberman Lab episode on sleep](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/25h2hoh7qpp4peu8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ubTFUeFFqOUlzUQ==) and [talking to circadian rhythm specialist Russell Foster](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/qvh8h7h8lmmom6cg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1MQlBZREVKNnFIYw==) made me focus a lot more on sleep last year.

I’ve been more rigorous about waking up at the same time, and feel way better for it.

### **🤔 6. The Pain of Rejection is Better than the Pain of Regret**
Whatever you’re struggling to do, shoot your shot. Whether it’s asking someone out, starting a business, moving to a new country… 99% of the time, the pain of failure or rejection is 100 times better than living with ‘what if’ for the rest of your life.

There have been some bumps along the way… but if I hadn’t [studied medicine](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/9qhzhnhgevvzvpfz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1nZXJreG1YQWhkSQ==), [started a YouTube channel](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/3ohphkhqk55453hp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1YcG9weU5aS1lLdw==), or [moved to London](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdu6wdnlomb7h70rkowhg/n2hohvhnl99696f0/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1aYXp3cXdqRFk2TQ==), I guarantee that I’d still be thinking about those things today with some mild regret.

So, _carpe diem_.
