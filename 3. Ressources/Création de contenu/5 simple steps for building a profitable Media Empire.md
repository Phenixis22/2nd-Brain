# Make your game plan
Now I know that if you're trying to build a media empire you might think that the first step would be "start posting online."

And while that makes sense...

It's the very reason many founders struggle to build an audience.

It might seem counter-intuitive, but the first step of building your media empire actually starts with the internal game plan.

Before you make your first post online...

**You need to take some time to get clear on what your niche is.**

Honing your niche is crucial because it allows you to stand out.

Attention is at a premium these days, and the easiest way to cut through the noise it by inventing your own category. 

In the words of David Sacks, **"The one who defines the category wins the category."**

Define your category in 2-4 clear words, and then run with it.

If you need help nailing your niche, use the Ikigai exercise.

# Determine your Ideal Audience

On of the most common mistakes I see founders make is using a "spray and pray" method when trying to build an audience.

Not only does this method make it highly unlikely you'll actually build a following...

**It's possible you could build a following of the wrong people.**

We're not just trying to build a following for the sake of numbers...

We want qualified people in our audience that can actually take advantage of what we sell.

To dial in on the people you want to attract, you want to start with your ideal customer.

Take some time to figure out who you can best help, and reverse engineer your audience growth strategy from there.

# Execute your content creation system
Now that you have completed these 2 crucial components, it's time to get to work and start building the media empire. How are you going to do that?

## Content

Content is perhaps the most powerful way to build and audience for two reasons.

First, it operates as a **magnet to draw in your ideal audience**. Like is attracted to like. As you put out content geared specifically for your ideal customer...

**People who resonate with what you share will start to follow along.**

Second, it **operates as a round-the-clock salesperson for your brand**.

Once you post something online, people can engage with it anytime.

Even better, they can share it, which gets you in front of even more relevant eyeballs.

The best part is, you don't even have to be awake for this to happen.

I can't tell you how many times I've gone to sleep and woken up to find my content has gone viral and I've acquired a ton of new followers.

Long-term your goal is to be omnipresent online, however, you don't want to start out on 13 different channels.

**Start with 2 platforms, and develop a content strategy to crush them first.**

I recommend you pick 4 different types of content categories you'll talk about, and make those pillars for your brand.

# Monetize your audience
Once you've started getting traction with your content, it's time to make an offer to your audience.

But selling something isn't just to put some cash in your bank account.

_Although that's a nice perk..._

**Selling something solidifies your position as the "go-to" expert in your niche.**

It allows you to deliver something that blows people's minds and gets them hyped up and talking about you even more.

I talked about systems for brand and community growth for a while before I launched anything.

But as soon as I started releasing courses, my position as "The Systems Guy" quickly solidified in people's minds.

If you're not sure what to offer, there are 3 easy ways to figure it out.

-   **Pay attention** to what people ask you for, and then create it
-   **See what topics resonate** well with your audience, and create your product around those topics 
-   **Ask select members** of your community what they'd like to buy from you

Once you've nailed your product, implement it immediately.

Here's a brief outline from how you can go from idea to "sold" with your next product:

1.  Go buy a domain at [GoDaddy](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ls/click?upn=Wz-2BIyoMFdpRCEwcL-2FvfF38kmiDttT6Lj2D8vnyzrUvM-3D_jxN_2KKVwpwgggLpChKnl-2B4-2FDrQ2AW-2FPhDxwpuZ-2BGMKT5-2FrVybfWF5zvR2QARtsT5CemVHvP7pzSW-2FHyFL-2FBlSPzn4KFiGJb3fyh88h9M1pnUW6kPXhqv-2FshG5dM0Y2AJzWqRb-2BHD6zfxom-2Fb0xDHnGglpkCrKSzsQQcNrW4n9uxTcJDFMeXiUIjwKb5twGGmP51LPdwwe8wY8NQyqH0wKRcwQ6mjBrfiP-2FzZ-2F16eTNs4bL1GAzU-2Bz371GRJNyEm8ORDwFPsVapqKgpIYFJJjGAB7osyVq8ALR9n9RgF7IMqe-2Bs3t3XRhUXhPJApPwXQMUTU1ECzTPk9fAeDzxa2bkPDPyUnvbLDKyl6JaKnWJbuOkruagslweqRDCYkF1sKBwW6epfSK21AeYn-2FEhSxMl09-2BSzRoH12z43-2F9BakJsv4KzQytuz6QXJDEgXThNbvUKSR)

# Iterate, improve, systemize and Scale 

**Building an empire starts with a single brick.**

But if you only lay one brick at a time it'll take you an eternity to build anything.

It's normal for there to be adjustments within each of the steps above.

After all, we're working with people...

And people are hardly straightforward creatures.

However, once you've got things decently dialed in, it's time to ramp things up.

You should start implementing tools and systems that allow you to produce content at scale.

I use various tools, have different content creation systems _(which I'll be sharing in a soon-to-be-released course)_ and I also leverage teams and outsource...

All to help me accomplish more.

_Here are some of the tools I use to help speed up my content creation process:_
