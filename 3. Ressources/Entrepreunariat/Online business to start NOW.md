# Selling ROI Marketing Services for Small Businesses
## Setup
Name :
buy the domain
set up business email
## Pick
### Pick a niche
Is your client making at least 10k/month ?
-> If lower, they won't be able to pay your fee
Do you understand the mechanics of this niche ?
-> you should be able to speak their language and so, they'll feel understood and it'll be easier to turn them into clients
### Pick a service
A ROI Service
a service that you can track a clear return on investment generated from it for the client
Result-based OR Revenue-driven
## Arbitrate
We'll pay a contractor, who has already experiences, etc..., just after we get paid by our clients. We'll just keep the difference
You'll be paid at the first day of the month, and you'll pay the contractor at the end, once he did the work
Never go below 60% margins to keep your agency profitable.
Be transparent with how much we get paid by our clients with the contractors
How do we find a contractor to work with you ?
Online. LinkedIn, UpWork, Business-related social platforms, job listing social platforms, etc... 
Facebook groups !
## Reach out
You won't have to deliver any work yourself, so 80% of your time should be spent on Outreach.
Way to do outreach :
- cold calling
- cold emails
- video audits
- LinkedIn Outreach
- Instagram Outreach

For video audits, use Loom.
Once the business owners react positively, jump on a call with them, present your offer and close them.
- [!] Don't be afraid of charging what you're worth

If you do this alone, it'll take you a few months to figure out of this works and how to make this work because :
- you pick the wrong niche or service
- you don't know what to look for when hiring a contractor
- you might make a few mistakes on your outreach efforts that could get your response rate close to 0

How to get results ?
#1 : take the information and try to figure it out by yourself
	-> you'll most likely lose valuable months trying to figure out everything on your own
	-> probably more expensive because you'll miss out a lot of money
	-> chance of quitting just goes way up
