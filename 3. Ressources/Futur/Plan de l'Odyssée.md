# Principe
You will envision your life in three ways under different criteria.
Detail everything you can about how you see your life – from your day-to-day work, the country you’re living in, relationships and interests. Be bold, big and clear.
1) **Write down what your life will look like in five years ==if you continue on the path you’re on right now.==** Even if that path seems hazy, extrapolate what you are currently studying or thinking about.
2) **Write down what your life will look in five years ==if you choose a different, but realistic alternative path.**== This could be one you have thought about but do not think is feasible, for whatever reason.
3) **Write down what your life will look like in five years if money and outside expectations of you didn’t matter.** This could be anything. Get wild. Get crazy.
4) **Can any parts of this come true in your actual life?**
# Application
1) In five years, I would be an entrepreneur. I'll work hard to create a company which will allow me to earn a lot of money. Thanks to that money, I'll be able to enjoy my family, my friends, etc...
2) In five years, I could also be ''just'' a developer in a company on a future subject, like quantic informatics or something like this. 
3) If money and outside expectations of me didn't matter, I would live in Finland with a daily routine based on reading, working out and outside, etc...
4) They all can, if I miss my entrepreneurial project, I can go back to the project of being a developer.
