## 7 levels along the journey of trying to remember everything you read
### 1st level : the muggle
Reading but just reading it, hoping to absord the topics
![[The forgetting curve]]
### 2nd level : the squib
Reading but highlighting or underlining things that particulaly resonates with you
we actually don't remember the stuff that we highlight, and they are hidden away inside ourthe book
### 3rd level : Hufflepuff
Systematic system to reviewing your highlight
### 4th level : Ravenclaw
A system whereby^[par lequel] you automatically pull in your highlights into a central note taking app
%%I'm actually between level 4 and 5 the first of October 2022%%
### 5th level : Dumbledore's army
Taking quick notes about the things that you've read
-> The book in 3 simple sentences
-> Impressions
-> How I discorvered it
-> Who should read it ?
-> How the book changed me
-> My top 3 quotes
Engaging with the stuff
### 6th level : The order of The Phoenix
Same thing as the level 5 but with a summary and some notes about the book that iI would write five stars of that have changed my life.
Summarizing each chapter by the things that actually resonates with me
This method allows to really engaged with the books because we actively rephrase things in our own words just to be sure that we've understood the concepts 
Secondly, we also can publish our personal book notes
### 7th level : Dumbledor
Turn our notes into permanent notes
***
R√©sum√© final : to remember a non-negligeable amount of data of what you read, the level 5 is really good and absolutely easy to reach. You just have to spend some minutes to answer the questions.
The level 6 upgrade the time you're spending, because it's really long to make a chapter-by-chapter summary.
The 7th level allows us to reuse the information we gather whenever we want. It takes a bit more time than the level 6 but if the chapter-by-chapter summary is done with the idea to create permanent notes, it can be done relatively easily without a large amount of time more.
