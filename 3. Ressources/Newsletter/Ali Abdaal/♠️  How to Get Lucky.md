I’ve been thinking a lot recently about randomness + serendipity.

See, I was invited to give a talk at the [1 Billion Followers Summit](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/48hvheh07n7qqoiq/aHR0cHM6Ly8xYmlsbGlvbnN1bW1pdC5jb20=) in Dubai this week. It ended up being super fun, and I hung out with a bunch of other creators (other speakers at the conference, and also attendees). But in all honesty, with all the travel I’ve been doing recently, I was feeling a bit burned out at the prospect of a 48-hour trip to Dubai of which 18 hours would be spent on an aeroplane 😂

But when taking the decision to go, the two questions I asked myself were:

**Question 1:** Is this something I’m likely to regret?

**Answer:** No. It’s just 1–2 days, I can work on the plane, it won’t really disrupt my life.

**Question 2:** Will this increase the serendipity in my life?

**Answer:** Yes. Who knows what life-changing thing could happen, or who I’ll meet. There’s a much higher chance of something interesting happening on this trip than if I stay at home.

And this time, optimising for serendipity paid off big time.

I met the business + finance creator [Erika Kullberg](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/wnh2hghrl3lv39fl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQEVyaWthMg==). And we had a fantastic conversation about business, team management, content strategy. It’s rare to find someone who has a [bigger audience](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/reh8hohqoeove2i6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9lcmlrYW5rdWxsYmVyZy8=) than me, while also having an identical business model. I absorbed so much incredible information.

And one conversation made the whole trip immediately “worth it” even outside the enjoyment of presenting and meeting people. I even told Erika that it was one of the highest ROI conversations I’ve ever had.

I’ve been banging this drum for a while but it’s worth saying again: never underestimate [the power](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/08hwh9hmpkpwk9up/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL2ZpbmRpbmctaW5zcGlyYXRpb24taW4tZHViYWkv) of [randomness](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/8ghqhohg7x7px3hl/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3RoZS12YWx1ZS1vZi1zYXlpbmcteWVzLw==) and [serendipity](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8undk4w6mfoh2v802xt6/vqh3hrhnqdq3d3tw/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3dpbmRvdy1vcGVuZXJzLXZzLWRvb3Ita25vY2tlcnMtMjAyMTIwLw==).

Only very rarely will you regret going to a networking event, meeting people or just **doing something** rather than sitting around at home.

Have a great week!
