# ü§´¬†The Power of Personal Assistants

Behind the scenes of most larger creators, and some smaller ones, is a personal assistant (usually virtual).

PAs can be game changing, sweeping up all the low leverage tasks like replying to emails and comments, scheduling stuff and personal admin, allowing you to focus on the biggest needle moving activities.

You can probably hire a good PA for around $15-20 per hour, and get them to do a whole range of things, but the more you pay the easier it will be to find someone particularly good.

There‚Äôs the usual tasks mentioned above, but for creators there's so much more potential. If you found a good PA they could also be repurposing long form YouTube videos or podcasts into shorter clips, tweet threads, blogs and newsletters.

They could be helping you do market research, come up with ideas or review your content. Things that could really move your business forwards.

Imagine if you found the right person and they could be trusted to sort everything else that isn‚Äôt the most important thing you need to do i.e. film videos.

So where do you find them? Well, finding someone good is difficult. These websites are great for hiring PAs who will sort out most of the admin side of things:¬†[Upwork](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx3vro4hg/l2hehmhoxnvn4dsg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXB3b3JrLmNvbS8=),¬†[Time etc](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx3vro4hg/m2h7h5ho4q0q9xal/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIudGltZWV0Yy5jby51ay8=),¬†[Wing](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx3vro4hg/e0hph7hkrlwlw9c7/aHR0cHM6Ly93aW5nYXNzaXN0YW50LmNvbS8=),¬†[Fancy Hands.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx3vro4hg/owhkhqh4q6l6l6sq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFuY3loYW5kcy5jb20v)

But if you want someone more invested in working with you and who can help you out with lots of different things, then you might have to look a bit further. These are some suggestions for places you could try looking: your existing audience if you have one, student forums, university pages or LinkedIn.

It might be an annoying process to try find someone good, but it'll be a breath of fresh air when you do.

# ‚è≥¬†Getting Disproportional Returns On Your Time

Most jobs and sources of income correlate directly with the amount of time you put in to them. You have some kind of hourly rate, and to earn a certain amount of money, you have to put in a certain number of hours.

If you don‚Äôt do the work, you don‚Äôt get paid.

Creatorpreneurs, however, understand that this is not a great proposal. That's why we've all turned to the creator economy. It's so attractive because it's a place where you can get disproportional returns for the amount of time you put in (as well as being lots of fun).

You can spend 1 hour making a YouTube video that gets 1 million views and earns you $1000 in a week, and then that video can continue to generate income for you as long as YouTube exists as a platform, without you having to do¬†_any_¬†_extra work._

Why? Because you‚Äôve created an¬†_asset_. An asset is something you (or the business) owns that can be used to produce positive economic value in future, and they are essential to detaching your time from your income, because assets can earn you money whilst you sleep¬†üò¥

As Creatorpreneurs, we should focus our time trying to build assets over the long term. Assets for creators might be things like videos, courses or ebooks. And then in the longer term, using the income from those assets to buy more assets like real estate and shares.

This makes you and/or your business a lot more resilient over time, because once you've created or acquired an asset, it can continue to work for you. The more valuable assets you have, the more resilient you become.

So hiring a personal assistant now, to allow you to work¬†_on_¬†the business and create assets, rather than working¬†_in_¬†the business, might just be an incredibly worthwhile investment.

In this exercise, you're going to determine your hypothetical hourly rate. Figuring this out can help you consider what to outsource.

For example, you could decide that you are worth $20 per hour, so it might be worth considering outsourcing tasks that are less than that hourly rate, like getting a cleaner for $10-15 per hour.

There are pitfalls to this way of thinking, but there‚Äôs utility in getting a ballpark figure for what your time is worth to your business, so you can hire people to do other things for you. Quick tip, your hypothetical rate is probably higher than you think.
