To be more intentional with my time, I’ve started using a method called the ‘Ideal Ordinary Week’.

Here’s how it works.

Imagine your ideal week, with all the activities you’d make time for – work, exercise, time with family, hobbies etc.

Then create a blank Google Calendar and block out reasonable times for your top priorities. For example:

-   8-9am every Tuesday and Thursday for exercise.
-   6-8pm every day for ‘family time’.
-   30 mins of reading each night, and lights off at 11pm.

You’ll end up a fairly full calendar. Here’s how my Ideal Ordinary Week looked when I drafted it a couple of weeks ago, for example:

I recommend drafting your ideal ordinary week in two phases:

**Phase 1 - Ideal ordinary week right now.**

Trying to imagine your ideal week **right now**, accounting for all the constraints of your current life. Once you’re done, move those blocks to your **real** calendar and set them as recurring events. This will help you make time for stuff that really matters.

**Phase 2 - Ideal ordinary week in the future.**

A year from now, or 3 years from now, what would you love a normal week to look like? For me, there’s now not much difference between “ideal week right now” and “ideal week in the future” (other than wanting to have kids some day, which is going to change it).

But when I had a day job, 10 hours of each weekday were “used up” on average. So I had to fit everything else in around that. So this is more of a goal-setting activity, to know what you’re working towards.

Here’s what my **real** calendar looks like for 5-11 December:

I’ve moved things around a bit to account for real life:

-   Recording [Not Overthinking](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvum3lvkn2h5hg0e2e4al/l2hehmhoxegg34hg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm90b3ZlcnRoaW5raW5nLmNvbS8=) on Wednesday (during the breakfast slot)

But overall it’s pretty reasonable.

**Three Key Benefits**

This Ideal Ordinary Week method has helped me in 3 main ways:

1.   ![🧘](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9d8/32.png) **Thinking Intentionally**  
    The simple act of constructing my ideal week makes me to think more intentionally about life, and how I’d like to spend my time.
2.   ![👉](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f449/32.png) **Useful Nudges**  
    The events on my calendar give my useful nudges. At 10pm, for example, I get a calendar notification saying ‘No more devices, bed and reading.” And I think “huh that’s a good idea – I think I **will** do that.’ It’s a gentle suggestion from my _intentional self_. Obviously stuff comes up. But it works most days.
3.  ![🛡️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6e1_fe0f/32.png)**Protecting My Time**  
    The calendar acts as a gatekeeper for my time. If I want to take on a new thing, I look at my calendar and see that most of the space is blocked out. So I’ll think “well I need to make space for this”.  
    ​  
    And if I don’t have space, then I think “that’s okay, it’s not a priority compared to these other things that I either have to do, or want to do”. This stops me from taking on too many tasks, then getting annoyed at myself for not having enough time. There literally aren’t enough hours in the day.

It’s literally as easy as creating a new calendar (Google, iCal, piece of paper), spending 15 minutes brainstorming your ideal week, then trialling your system and making tweaks along the way. Give it a try.
