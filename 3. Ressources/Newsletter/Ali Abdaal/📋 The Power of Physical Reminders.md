This weekâ€™s message is pretty simple: never underestimate the power of physical reminders.

For the past weeks my team and I have used four bigÂ [Magic Whiteboards](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvum3lvkn2h5hg05pelal/owhkhqh4q2zooduq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL1d6YmFhU0I=)Â (stuck to the studio wall) to plan all our YouTube content. Itâ€™s honestly been a huge productivity hack.

We do have a detailed production calendar in Notion. But having our guiding goals and principles on the wall keeps everyone focused and working in sync on big goals that matter.

(Btw Iâ€™m usingÂ [these OG Magic Whiteboards](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvum3lvkn2h5hg05pelal/p8heh9h9qnvxxwsr/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzZVWGVz).)

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on the 4 whiteboards:

1.  **YouTube Clubs**  
    A list of the 12 â€˜typesâ€™ of video that I tend to make, including Tech Club, Health Club, Business Club, etc. If I ever get stuck thinking of a video idea, I glance at the list and ask myself â€˜which of these have I not covered recently?â€™
2.  **Rules of the Game**  
    Itâ€™s hugely helpful to have these guiding principles on the wall - it reminds everyone (especially me) of what makes a good video, and of our high production standards. Itâ€™s so easy to technicallyÂ **know**Â something (like â€˜always have a snappy video hookâ€™) but still forget toÂ **apply**Â that knowledge. I try to run through the whole list before filming/uploading any video.
3.  **Project Blow Up the Channel With Shorts  
    â€‹**YouTube Shorts can drive a lot of extra views, netting more subscribers whoâ€™ll get value from my long-form videos. So Iâ€™m trying to consistently publish a lot of them, using this content board as inspiration. This is similar to theÂ [Seinfeld Strategy](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvum3lvkn2h5hg05pelal/x0hph6hnq5g335ug/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS9zdG9wLXByb2NyYXN0aW5hdGluZy1zZWluZmVsZC1zdHJhdGVneQ==)Â - build up a streak for long enough and you wonâ€™t want to break it. Filming a big batch of ShortsÂ **can**Â feel a bit tedious, but this chart helps me internalise that itâ€™s all part of a grand plan rather than being pointless grunt work.
4.  **Project Long Form**  
    Similar concept to the Shorts board. Iâ€™m aiming to publish roughly x2 long-form videos per week, and this chart reminds me + the team of that commitment every day. I write down what videos weâ€™re aiming to release that week, and we all get a little kick of satisfaction when theyâ€™re uploaded and crossed off.

If you find yourself getting lost in the nitty-gritty of everyday life, I highly recommend giving yourself some physical reminders. Streak charts, wall calendars, Post-It notes â€“ theyâ€™re all a good, constant reminder of your priorities.

Iâ€™ll report back in a few weeks on how this experiment plays out.

Most â€˜productivity hacksâ€™ feel game-changing for the first week or so, then get less effective as the novelty wears offâ€¦ But thatâ€™s a topic for another issueÂ ðŸ˜›
