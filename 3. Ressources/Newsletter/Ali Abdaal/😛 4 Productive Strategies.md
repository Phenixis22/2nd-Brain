My basic idea is that play and productivity aren’t opposed to one another. In fact, anything that makes work more playful or energising will also make it more productive.

Double win.

Whenever I struggle with being consistent or productive, I ask myself ‘how could I make this more fun?’ I try to approach the task ([writing my book](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/3ohphkhqp9zv4dtp/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL2Jvb2stam91cm5leS8=), [going to the gym](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/n2hohvhn75re6ns0/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3N0YXJ0aW5nLW15LWZpdG5lc3Mtam91cm5leS8=), [filming a long course](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/48hvheh0xqgk6riq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj15Y2hib1dLbk9hcw==)) in a **spirit of play**.

These are my 4 main strategies:

**🤝 1. Do It With a Friend**  
Everything’s more fun when you add a social element. Food shopping, [exam revision](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/wnh2hghr0vg8xqsl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2tpbGxzaGFyZS5jb20vY2xhc3Nlcy9Ib3ctdG8tU3R1ZHktZm9yLUV4YW1zLUFuLUV2aWRlbmNlLUJhc2VkLU1hc3RlcmNsYXNzLzcyODc0ODAyNg==), working out… The right friend will motivate you, and take your mind off the most unpleasant bits of the task. At med school for example, my friends and I would gather in my room, and we’d make a game out of memorising facts for our exams.

**🎮 2. Track Your Progress**  
|I have way more fun at the gym if I track my progress, and see the incremental gains. This is [gamification](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/08hwh9hmlwzqgzbp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1FTGF2dXozYnRhRQ==) 101: video games have level up bars and exp. points because they make any task fun/engrossing. It also makes YouTubing addictive, because you can see your views and subscribers spike in real time every time you post a video. To make any task more fun try to track your progress. You could use the [Seinfeld Strategy](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/8ghqhohgrp9kqksl/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS9zdG9wLXByb2NyYXN0aW5hdGluZy1zZWluZmVsZC1zdHJhdGVneQ==), compete with a friend, or challenge yourself to hit a target (eg write 300 words every 30 minutes).

**🧘 3. Be Sincere, Not Serious** Instead of treating life like a hustle to get to your final destination, take philosopher [Alan Watts](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/vqh3hrhnw3g8emfw/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL2hvdy10by1maW5kLWNyZWF0aXZlLWZyZWVkb20v)’ advice and think of it more like a musical performance, where the point is to enjoy it in the moment. Once you get into that mindset, it’s much easier to enjoy work. Like ‘damn, I actually get to sit here and write my article. Life is amazing.’

**⚔️ 4. Do Side-Quests** Sometimes you just get stuck on a task. Let’s say I’m writing an article about topic X and get writer’s block. I find it useful to follow my curiosity, and explore a related topic for a while as a fun side-quest. This usually leads to:

1.  Accidental progress on topic X anyway.
2.  Me feeling more relaxed, and my writer’s block disappearing.
3.  Generating other great ideas that I can follow up later.

I hope this helps - have a great week! 😊

**📚 Book -** [Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8u7wxgo8ktrhx33x56uw/p8heh9h9q5x8x5tr/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzd5Zmhodw==) by Luke Burgis. About our instinctive urge to copy other people, and whether it really make us happy. I feel like I’ve levelled up my understanding of the world a lot from reading this book. It’s also amazingly written. This is unusual for a non-fiction self-help book, but Luke’s writing style kept me hooked.
