Shockingly, I only just got round to reading the productivity classic [Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u87lpzg2sqhkl4dqecq/owhkhqh4qwd0d8cq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzNLMVNW) this week.

And what stuck me most was this retelling of the fable of [The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u87lpzg2sqhkl4dqecq/z2hghnholexmxotz/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVGhlX0dvb3NlX3RoYXRfTGFpZF90aGVfR29sZGVuX0VnZ3M=):

This fable is the story of a poor farmer, who one day discovers, in the nest of his pet goose, a glittering golden egg […] Much to his surprise, the egg is pure gold!  
​  
The farmer can’t believe his good fortune, and he becomes even more incredulous the following day when the experience is repeated. Day after day he awakens, to rush to the nest and find another golden egg. But with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience. Unable to wait day after day for the golden eggs, the farmer decides he will KILL the goose and get them all at once.  
​  
But when he opens his goose, he finds it empty. There are no golden eggs. And now there is no way to get anymore. The farmer has destroyed the goose that produced them.

I remember this story from years ago, when my mum would read me Aesop’s Fables. But I have a new perspective on it now, as an adult, thanks to reading [7 Habits](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u87lpzg2sqhkl4dqecq/owhkhqh4qwd0d8cq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzNLMVNW).

It’s all about _effectiveness_.

Most people focus on ‘golden eggs’ when thinking about effectiveness. Producing impressive short-term outcomes (money, social prestige, or enjoying life to the max). But as the fable shows, and as Stephen Covey writes about in the book, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what’s **produced** (the golden eggs) and the **producing asset / capacity to produce** (the goose).

If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs but neglects the goose, you’ll soon lose the asset that produces those golden eggs for you.

I find myself doing this way too often with my physical body.

I think: ‘work is fun, let me just do some more work, as I’m on a roll. I don’t need to go for a run today, or go to the gym, or eat something healthy. Who cares if I skip a workout? I’ll just do it tomorrow… ’

The problem here is that I’m optimising for **producing** more golden eggs in the short term (writing, videos, etc). But I’m neglecting my **production capacity** - in other words, the physical goose that makes all that possible. Use a machine all the time but never maintain it, and it’ll eventually break. You need basic maintenance to get good long-term results.

Side note - Obviously, I’m not implying that the only benefit of a healthy body is that it helps drive economic production. Just that **even if** you’re optimising for economic production (the eggs), it still makes a **lot** of sense to take care of the goose.

This applies to a lot of other areas in life:

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don’t continually invest in improving our own production capacity, we massively restrict how many golden eggs we can produce in future.

I’m pretty good at this one (staying curious, learning new skills, taking courses). But I know plenty of people who aren’t.

![💔](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f494/32.png) **Relationships**

In a romantic relationship, golden eggs are the good times you have with your partner. The goose is the health of the relationship. Maintaining that healthy relationship takes communication, compromise, commitment.

Same thing goes for friendships. You can’t have those fun hangout sessions and crazy times without putting in work to maintain the friendship, keeping in touch, etc. You have to spend time taking care of the goose.

There is a caveat though. If you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you’ll soon be unable to **feed** that goose (ie make a decent living). Effectiveness lies in the balance: getting the desired results in a sustainable way.
