I had an incredible day on Monday.

Iâ€™ve been looking for a clear mission statement for my company for a while now. AÂ [north star](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/8ghqhohgm427l9tl/aHR0cHM6Ly9va2RvcmsuY29tL2FsaS1hYmRhYWwtMjAyMS8=)Â goal that isnâ€™t about yearly revenue or KPIs.

So for the first time ever, my whole team gathered in London, and we had a 2-day strategy session facilitated by the amazingÂ [Daniel Priestley](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/vqh3hrhnz5vqp8uw/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9EYW5pZWxQcmllc3RsZXk=).

Danâ€™s a business coach, author ([Oversubscribed](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/l2hehmho8gnd3qug/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL1h5YUdjTA==),Â [Key Person of Influence](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/m2h7h5hodrql8vil/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL1A0VktS)), and creator ofÂ [ScoreApp](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/dpheh0hql3o206bl/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYW5pZWxwcmllc3RsZXkuY29tL3Njb3JlY2FyZC1tYXJrZXRpbmcv), a cool way of creating online quizzes for your audience.

I was blown away by how useful the session with Dan was. I wonâ€™t go into the nitty-gritty, but he was super-thoughtful and energetic, and helped us discuss issues in a way weâ€™d never done before as a team.

We also settled on a new companyÂ **vision**:

> _We help people build a life they love._

And new companyÂ **mission:**

> _We do this by creating content that inspires and educates, and by giving people the tools and resources they can use to build a life they love._

Everyone felt â€˜yes, this is it - this rings true as our mission statement.â€™

Anyway, I got 5 main insights from this whole experience, which even if youâ€™re not an entrepreneur, Iâ€™m hoping will apply to you:

**1. The Power of Coaching  
**If you want to grow or improve at something, itâ€™s incredibly useful to bring in a coach or mentor. Business coaching, guitar lessons, therapy, etc. A good coach will give you a ton of insight based on their huge knowledge bank. Theyâ€™ll also bring a fresh pair of eyes to bear on the situation, which is particularly useful if youâ€™ve been stuck on one issue for a long time.

**2. The Power of Twitter**.  
Dan and I followed each other on Twitter for a while before meeting in person. And the first time we talked in private was also over Twitter DMs. If youâ€™re not already on Twitter, I highly recommend it as a way of connecting with cool people. It lets you have conversationsÂ [with literally anyone](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/e0hph7hk8xld0oi7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1tN1h1eWhad0dJUQ==). And if you post interesting content, you can build a following inÂ [just a few months](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/7qh7h8h0rg6xo7b9/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lcmljYXNteW5hbWUvc3RhdHVzLzE1ODQ2MTI5NzgyOTYzOTc4MzQ=).

**3. The Power of Starting a YouTube Channel**.  
YouTube is also an amazing way of connecting with people you admire. If you make videos about a topic you love, then even if you get ~1000 views you can guarantee some interesting people are watching. And trust me, some of them will get in touch. This happened to me all the time in my first year on YouTube.  
 
In fact, if you want to get started on YouTube you could do a lot worse than sign up to myÂ [Part-Time YouTuber Academy](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/owhkhqh42z60rmtq/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY2FkZW15LmFsaWFiZGFhbC5jb20v), where I walk you through the whole processâ€¦Â ðŸ˜‰Â Enrolment actuallyÂ [opens tomorrow](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/owhkhqh42z60rmtq/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY2FkZW15LmFsaWFiZGFhbC5jb20v)Â - take a look if youâ€™re interested. Weâ€™ve also got a bunch of scholarships available if youâ€™re serious about YouTube but canâ€™t afford the course.  


**4. The Power of Having a Podcast.**Â A little while after connecting on Twitter, I invited Dan to talk on myÂ [Deep Dive podcast](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/z2hghnhoqgkm3quz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9EZWVwRGl2ZXdpdGhBbGlBYmRhYWw=)Â (episode should be out fairly soon). We got to know each other better, and that led to this weekâ€™s in-person coaching.  
  
This is a great example of how hosting a podcast also gives you the perfect excuse to meet people you admire. Itâ€™s much easier to say â€˜do you want to do an interview on my podcast?â€™ than â€˜will you be my friend?â€™  

Even if my Deep Dive podcast lost money, Iâ€™d still do it just to chat with people likeÂ [Will MacAskil](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/x0hph6hn5gp4w4ug/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1Za2RJOHp0cVdaYw==)l,Â [Julian Hearn](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/6qheh8hpmq5374a9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1XX0wtbkllMTRraw==), andÂ [Julie Smith](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4r9e2psz/kkhmh6h8k75ol7fk/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ETTFfMTVielU1TQ==), amongst others ðŸ˜ƒ

**5. The Power of Meeting In-Person**  
Having the whole team in the same room for those two days was massively energising. Everyone left feeling inspired and on the same page. And that was mostly down to having quality face-to-face time (complete with lunch and random chit-chat).

Whatever youâ€™re working on, I highly recommend meeting people in-person as much as possible: it deepens relationships about x5â€“x10 faster than DMs and Zoom calls.
