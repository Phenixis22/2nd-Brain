# Hello
There’s a _Wholesome Crypto_ podcast, a coin named serene, and a way to buy gifts from Calm, the meditation app, with crypto. You can send payments through a system called Decaf and buy cute merch that says  “Keep calm and HODL.” So there ya go. Crypto land is nothing but ~chill vibes~. Try not to doze off.

-   **Markets:** Coin prices were mixed to start the week—or was everyone just exhausted by all the FTX drama? Bitcoin has hovered just under $17,000, and very few coins have been up over the past week (except for trust wallet token and binance USD). There was heavy trading of stablecoins on Monday, with tether being the most-traded coin in crypto. Stable. What a nice idea.

# Crypto currently - Crypto’s having an existential crisis

In case you just returned to civilization from a silent retreat: a) we’re jealous, and b) the crypto exchange FTX has gone belly-up and bankrupt. Its collapse has far-reaching effects on the crypto industry, especially as we learn how many projects were deeply invested in by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his hedge fund Alameda Research.

**Big picture:** One curly-haired dude’s outsized power has become an existential crisis for crypto, since the whole point of blockchain tech is to mitigate how much power any one party can wield. NFX general partner Morgan Beller told Incrypto that “the possible web of contagion could be much deeper than people realize.”

Consider, for example, the Solana blockchain, which is [undergoing](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29706837.55377/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3RyZWV0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktc29sYW5hLWNvbGxhcHNlcy1pbi1mdHgtc2NhbmRhbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBaae60c76) a major stress test of its underlying “decentralized” promise. The platform claims it is truly independent and controlled only by its users. “What exactly is the advantage of all this decentralization? When the network isn’t controlled by a single entity, that means…networks can’t be compromised or shut down due to one large controlling entity,” the company wrote on its website.

Solana is now in jeopardy because of a project connected to FTX.

FTX and Alameda Research built a decentralized exchange called Serum on the Solana blockchain in 2020. But in the fallout from FTX’s implosion—during which the price of Solana’s native token fell about 45% over the past week—developers suggested that SBF’s involvement compromised Solana’s decentralized nature:

-   SBF called the Serum exchange “truly, fully trustless”—meaning no authority controlled it—because it was operated by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
-   But developers told Coindesk that Alameda Research had enough power in the DAO to single-handedly make decisions about Serum.
-   Now, developers [are editing](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29706837.55377/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTIvZnR4LWhhY2stc3Bvb2tzLXNvbGFuYS1kZWZpLWNvbW11bml0eS1pZ25pdGluZy1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLWF0LWFsYW1lZGEtY29udHJvbGxlZC1zZXJ1bS1kZXgvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBeb90b061) SBF’s involvement out of Serum like he’s Ned Fulmer and they’re The Try Guys.

Brock Pierce—the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, Tether, and several other crypto companies—told Incrypto that Solana’s an example of “concentration risk,” and that any company that’s grazed SBF has a reserved ticket for the struggle bus. “People just are like, ‘I don’t want anything to do with anything they touched.’”

SBF wanted to be the epitome of “trustless”…and now he is. The question is how far that suspicion will spread by association.—_JW_

# Hang on a minute - ‘Climbing out of the mud’ of scandal
‘Climbing out of the mud’ of scandalStellar Development Foundation
As a lawyer for Yahoo in 2007, Denelle Dixon watched Congress grill her bosses about the mishandling of personal user information. Now Dixon is the CEO of a nonprofit called Stellar Development Foundation, which focuses on smart contracts and cross-border payments to people without bank accounts. Incrypto sat down with her to talk regulation post-FTX crisis.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

We may be looking at some quickly unfolding regulation, which is an area where you have particular expertise. Is that also what you see coming?

Yeah, and the challenge that we now have is that Sam Bankman-Fried spent a lot of time gaining credibility with a lot of these regulators.

He was perhaps the biggest political player in crypto, and even donated $40 million. When his company falls apart, does that cause the political powers to wonder who they can trust?

I feel like as an industry, we’ve taken a tremendous amount of steps forward. And now we’re 100 steps back just from a policy standpoint because regulators are going to be concerned about who they can trust. It’s [definitely] one of my biggest concerns.

Do you think we’re going to have political theater? Whether it’s Elizabeth Warren or AOC, they’re going to want to question the people involved in consumer protection.

Yeah, I do. You see that already happening with Warren’s letter [last month] where there’s a lot of good focus on consumer protection. And unfortunately, this allows those who are already very skeptical of this industry to layer on that skepticism.

How do you evangelize to lay people that the blockchain technology underneath crypto has nothing to do with coin prices or these scandals?

When you’re dealing with value and people’s money, it’s very hard for people to make that distinction. They’re going to be concerned about crypto…which is why one of the things we always really focus on is the use of stablecoins. We’ve already seen an increase in stablecoin usage.

When this all subsides, how does the industry return to the benefits of blockchain and give people that much subtler message?

I’ve been before Congress three or four different times, and every single time I am there to talk about the use cases. And frankly, it’s incumbent upon all of us to be there to talk about the use cases…We’re working right now with really large NGOs to deliver aid into countries that really need that aid [and] leveraging the blockchain…You know, when you’re in the mud, it’s hard to climb out of it. But I feel very positive about our future because I know what this technology can do.—JE
