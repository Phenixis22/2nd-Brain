# Hello
Remember poor Rahul Ligma and Daniel Johnson, who got fired from Twitter? Well, Ligma also got fired from FTX not even a month later. Except…these are pranksters (read their last names together if you haven’t already) who didn’t work at either company.

Good news this week in their silly little saga though: Twitter rehired them!

-   **Markets:** Things have been oddly stable amid the FTX chaos. Bitcoin’s been a bit up, and ether’s been a bit down this past week. Even dogecoin has chilled out. And everybody has been trading stablecoins. Sometimes a coin that’s always worth just a dollar is so reassuring.
-   **Economy:** The picture is looking better, right? Inflation is cooling, the Nasdaq is warming up, and the Fed may give everyone a tiny break on interest rates. Wrong, says the Economist with the headline “[Even a global recession may not bring down inflation](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvbm9taXN0LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlLWFuZC1lY29ub21pY3MvMjAyMi8xMS8xNS9ldmVuLWEtZ2xvYmFsLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1tYXktbm90LWNydXNoLWluZmxhdGlvbg/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd4a67a41).” In their view, “There is scant evidence inflation is anywhere near defeated. Indeed, in much of the world it is broadening out.” It hurts more because they always say it with such class.
# Crypto currently - SBF must be sneezing so much right now
Having a conversation about crypto right now without talking about the downfall of the crypto exchange FTX is like watching _The Two Towers_ in a room full of LOTR fans and no one mentioning Viggo Mortensen’s [broken toe](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly9rbm93eW91cm1lbWUuY29tL21lbWVzL3ZpZ2dvLW1vcnRlbnNlbi1icm9rZS1oaXMtdG9lLWluLXRoZS10d28tdG93ZXJzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBc541be9a): It’s virtually impossible.

Everyone’s weighing in with their hot takes on where CEO founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) went wrong and what’s next for crypto.

By Nov. 8, suspicion was rising that FTX’s finances were suss but FTX had not yet declared bankruptcy. Do Kwon—the Terraform Labs co-founder who’s wanted by South Korean authorities—showed SBF the kind of empathy that perhaps only he can on the [_UpOnly_ podcast](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ZaW1CVE03a3dqYyZ0PTQ1ODFz/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB87a3665e):

-   “S--t happens all the time and doing effective crisis management is not easy…It doesn’t really seem like average users understand the complexity and the stress.”

Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was quick to give his opinion on FTX while simultaneously defending the legitimacy of his own centralized crypto exchange (he even threw on a tie for interviews). He included some [hopeful notes](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9icmlhbl9hcm1zdHJvbmcvc3RhdHVzLzE1OTAwODk0NjgxNTcyNDMzOTQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB9c6e9d6c) in a Nov. 8 Twitter thread like, “Long term, the crypto industry has an opportunity to build a better system.”

CEO Jesse Powell of the crypto exchange Kraken was [similarly hopeful](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9qZXNwb3cvc3RhdHVzLzE1OTA2MzUyMzA1NTMzMjk2NjQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe896590c) in his tweet thread two days later, but added that he’s “really trying to control [his] rage,” which was the emotion of choice across Twitter. “This f----r stole from us. @SBF_FTX / No two ways about it, theft. Rot in jail bro,” the crypto influencer known as “Trader Mayne” [tweeted](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9UcmFkZXJtYXluZS9zdGF0dXMvMTU5MDM3MDkxODcyMzExNzA1Nz9yZWZfc3JjPXR3c3JjJTVFdGZ3JTdDdHdjYW1wJTVFdHdlZXRlbWJlZCU3Q3R3dGVybSU1RTE1OTAzNzA5MTg3MjMxMTcwNTclN0N0d2dyJTVFZWY3ZDg0NjkxNGRjMGFmZjM3ZDE5N2NkMDJkNTZjMDRkNjBmZjE5ZSU3Q3R3Y29uJTVFczFfJnJlZl91cmw9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZuZnRub3cuY29tJTJGZmVhdHVyZXMlMkZ3aGF0LXRoZS1uZnQtc3BhY2Utb2YtdGhlLWZ0eC1kZWJhY2xlJTJG/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB60c7fff7) on Nov. 9.

By Nov. 12, people had moved on from reacting → sorting through the rubble for red flags they had missed. Experts had several insightful tidbits to add during that day’s [_All-In_ podcast](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1JZDdjTnF3cXQxSQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efC2f185667).

-   Armstrong said he “did not see this coming” but had raised an eyebrow at FTX’s lavish spending earlier this year.
-   Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya talked about how a rep from FTX had told him to “Go f--k yourself” when he requested the company to make some changes (like create a board of directors) before he’d invest.

A few days later, the collective internet went from Hulk Angry to Hulk Smash when the NYT published [a profile](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Z0eC1zYW0tYmFua21hbi1mcmllZC1jcnlwdG8tYmFua3J1cHRjeS5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd1a74777) of SBF that was widely considered a [puff piece](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9tcmphc29uY2hvaS9zdGF0dXMvMTU5MjUwMjc4NTg3MzgyNTc5ND9zPTIwJnQ9YkxzZlpRS3Zob05QYlJmSlMxb3VZZw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB65e81c24) for going too soft on the fallen founder. Since then, industry insiders have been publishing their own versions of events. Berkshire Hathaway vice chair Charlie Munger [chimed in](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vdmlkZW8vMjAyMi8xMS8xNS9jaGFybGllLW11bmdlci13ZWlnaHMtaW4tb24tY3J5cHRvLWNvbGxhcHNlLXdlLWRvLW5vdC1uZWVkLWN1cnJlbmN5LWZvci1raWRuYXBwZXJzLmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBdd67c47f) on CNBC to say, “[It’s like] every 12-year-old can be a billionaire or something. He just calls it mungercoin and starts trading it or something. It’s crazy, it’s demented.”

**Zoom out:** Let’s leave the last word (for now) with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who on Tuesday advised the world to [not let](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9WaXRhbGlrQnV0ZXJpbi9zdGF0dXMvMTU5MjQ1NDg5OTQzNDE0Nzg0MT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB0dea83d5) SBF’s Midas-turned-Rogue touch kill the crypto industry: “Automatically downgrading every single thing SBF believed in is an error.”—_JW_

The collapse has been a dumpster fire,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee.

**Big-time banks** like Wells Fargo and Mastercard are testing out a new blockchain-based [digital dollar](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzExNDc2MS91cy1iYW5rcy1sYXVuY2gtZGlnaXRhbC1kb2xsYXItYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1wbGF0Zm9ybS1waWxvdD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB2451154a).

“Contagion” is a scary word—and maybe the worst first-date movie ever. So as that word spreads throughout the FTX crypto crisis, eyes widen and teeth clench. Contagions cause bank runs, and bank runs cause crashes.

On Wednesday, headlines spread the word to the crypto firm Genesis and the investor Grayscale. “Is Genesis, Grayscale Next Amid FTX Contagion?” asked [one report](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2lubWFya2V0Y2FwLmNvbS9oZWFkbGluZXMvbmV3cy9mdHgtY29udGFnaW9uLXJlYWNoZXMtZ3JheXNjYWxlLWFyZS1nYnRjLWV0aGUtbmV4dC1mdHQvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB29c17095) on the crypto price site Coinmarketcap.com.

## Here’s why that matters

According to PitchBook, Genesis and Grayscale are owned by the same monster crypto conglomerate that has $90 billion invested in more than 300 companies. The Digital Currency Group (DCG) boasts it is “the epicenter of the bitcoin and blockchain industry” and could potentially spread a crypto contagion like it’s a preschool during cold season.

So in terms of the the FTX crisis, DCG is:

-   An investor in FTX
-   Owner of CoinDesk, the crypto news site that broke the news
-   An investor in Elliptic, an analytics company that is investigating the scandal
-   Owner of Genesis, a crypto bank that halted withdrawals on Wednesday after disclosing that $175 million of its assets were locked in FTX accounts

Those are a lot of different hats to wear in one crisis, and some see that as a real problem. “DCG’s control of so much of the ecosystem allows them to heavily influence various narratives and assure victory regardless of variable outcomes,” crypto entrepreneur and analyst Kurt Wuckert Jr. wrote in a [historical analysis](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2luZ2Vlay5jb20vd2hvLWlzLWRpZ2l0YWwtY3VycmVuY3ktZ3JvdXAvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6dcf9ffc) of DCG back in May. DCG declined to comment for Incrypto.

Wuckert believes DCG set out to control the crypto ecosystem, and in many ways has succeeded. That’s…not very decentralized.

“DCG was designed to filter profits up to old-world financial interests,” he wrote to Incrypto via Twitter direct message, “while selling fake decentralization to retail investors.”

DCG founder Barry Silbert may have admitted as much. “The model I use as an inspiration is Standard Oil,” he [told the WSJ](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kaWdpdGFsLWN1cnJlbmN5LWdyb3VwLXdhbnRzLXRvLWJlLWNyeXB0b3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQtb2lsLTExNjM1NzY0NDAwP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB26473a44) last year. “This is a particularly troubling comment,” a market watchdog [told Congress](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29730518.65706/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamVjLnNlbmF0ZS5nb3YvcHVibGljL19jYWNoZS9maWxlcy9hYTM4NzkxNy05NDU2LTRiMWYtYTk0OC1mMDg2NTk0YzRkMTUvYWxleGlzLWdvbGRzdGVpbi1qZWMtY3J5cHRvLWhlYXJpbmctdGVzdGltb255LnBkZj91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB008a875b). Standard Oil money was used in a way that caused the first US stock market crash and was broken up by the Supreme Court because it was a monopoly—the antithesis of a decentralized economy.—_JE_
