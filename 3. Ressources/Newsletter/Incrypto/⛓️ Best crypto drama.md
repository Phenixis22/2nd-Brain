# Hello
 Some BFD news was announced this morning: The largest crypto exchange, Binance, signed a letter of intent to buy the third largest crypto exchange, FTX. We break that down some below—and stay tuned for the next issue of Incrypto on Thursday, when we’ll untangle the acquisition drama like it’s the season finale of _Love Is Blind_.

Flowcarbon is [launching](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvbWUvMjAyMjExMDcwMDU3OTUvZW4vRmxvd2NhcmJvbi1MYXVuY2hlcy1GbG93M3JzLUEtQ29sbGVjdGlvbi1vZi1EZWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLUFydC1Gb3ItQ2xpbWF0ZT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB96df4200) Flow3rs, its first collection of NFT artworks that depict humans’ relationship with the environment. Since the majority of the proceeds will be used to buy carbon credits, the green Web3 company says the NFTs are “net carbon negative.” It’s the latest effort by a crypto company to help save the environment by blockchain-ifying it.

**Some backstory:** Flowcarbon was co-founded in 2021 by Adam Neumann, the eccentric co-founder of WeWork, who has elevated his mission from infusing water with fruit cut to read “TGIM” ([seriously](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS93ZXdvcmsvc3RhdHVzLzk5ODY4MTgzODA3NDk0MTQ0MD9sYW5nPWVu/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB661119f8)) to selling carbon credits on the blockchain. As a climate tech company, Flowcarbon makes it easier for companies and individuals to buy carbon credits, an asset that represents CO2 eliminated by projects such as forest preservation.

## Flowcarbon’s part of a crowded field

Grouped together as “regenerative finance” (ReFi), many companies are trying to preserve the Earth by putting carbon credits on the blockchain. But it’s up for debate whether ReFi is more Captain Planet or Mr. Burns.

**Critics say…**these projects are hammers looking for a nail. They make _trading_ carbon credits easier, which could [further crunch](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9yZWNvZGUvMjMxNDIxMDYvYWRhbS1uZXVtYW5uLWNyeXB0by1jYXJib24tY3JlZGl0LW9mZnNldC1mbG93Y2FyYm9uP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB895e89be) the already limited supply of legitimate carbon credits. (Carbon credits have faced issues in the past when, for instance, a project preserved a forest that was already protected, which…yeesh.) There’s also evidence that people buy carbon credits through Web3 companies to flip them for a profit rather than “retire” them, which means to permanently take them off the market.

-   Less than 2% of carbon credits that have been moved onto the blockchain had been retired as of July, per data from KlimaDao, another green Web3 company. Notably, all carbon credits purchased through Flow3rs will be retired upon purchase.

**Proponents say…**because blockchains are publicly viewable, they ensure that the projects behind carbon credits are more legitimate. And for Flowcarbon specifically, co-founder and chief blockchain officer Phil Fogel told Incrypto that a) its standards for climate credit projects are “extremely rigorous,” and b) the company used the energy-efficient Ethereum blockchain for Flow3rs to minimize its carbon footprint.

**Bottom line:** Some think crypto companies and the environment pair like beluga caviar and a Coors Light, but Web3 companies like Flowcarbon hope to carve out a green future for Web3…in their own way.—_JW_

But the 50,676 bitcoins are worth about a third of that. Well, turns out the DOJ used the value when the loot was seized a year ago, at more than $60,000. Today it tumbled below $20,000. Zhong got in at the beginning, HODL’d until the very peak, then dumped it all. Well executed. Except for the 20 years in prison he faces. (Yikes.)

**JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon**, who hates attention almost as much as Elon Musk, called crypto a “Ponzi scheme” in September. But that’s centuries ago in crypto time.

# Hang on a minute - Mees the wholesome hackers of crypto

Here’s a word you don’t often hear used to describe crypto: _wholesome._

Wholesome? The intersection of tech and finance that has made and lost fortunes while governments and ordinary people just try to stay afloat? The industry that makes headlines because of [stolen billions](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS10aGVmdC1oYWNrZXItY2hhaW5hbHlzaXMtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1jcmltZS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldyM6fjp0ZXh0PUElMjBiaWclMjBjaHVuayUyMG9mJTIwdGhhdCxnbyUyQyUyMiUyMHRoZSUyMGNvbXBhbnklMjB0d2VldGVkLg/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB7efd2cf0)? Maybe crypto is wholesome the same way _Succession_ is a family TV show. No, actual wholesome. _Ted Lasso_ Christmas episode wholesome.

“It’s really wholesome,” said United Market Access (UMA) co-founder Hart Lambur to Incrypto from a San Francisco “[hackathon](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly9zZi5ldGhnbG9iYWwuY29tLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe4ab6ce4).” Lambur’s company helps developers build better smart contracts that manage financial transactions with computer programs.

There is a global community of Ethereum developers that gather at hackathons, where they compete like crazy to create new products and win prizes. This year, similar events have taken place in New York, Amsterdam, and Mexico.

You can pile more stuff on the Ethereum blockchain than on your first plate at Thanksgiving. Besides smart contracts, non-fungible tokens, the unique digital media known as NFTs, are also built on the Ethereum blockchain.

### **Here’s a big difference between the two biggest coins**

Behind only bitcoin, ether is the No. 2 crypto coin in the world by market capitalization. But the two cryptocurrencies are very different. Bitcoin is a coin…and that’s basically all it is. There’s no company behind bitcoin, and we don’t even know who founded it. But Ethereum is a movement of developers and companies loosely connected by [a Swiss nonprofit](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldGhlcmV1bS5vcmcvZW4vZm91bmRhdGlvbi8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBb551052f), and they have a shared goal of creating a new financial and tech industry.

But the movement is building projects that could someday make lots of money. And Lambur’s company wasn’t the only one riding along with [white-hat hackers](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29633773.58008/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2luY3J5cHRvL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8xMC8yNy9jcnlwdG8tYnVnLWJvdW50aWVzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pYyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcmbWlkPTIzMGRmNzAyNDdkOTY2NmQwMzQwOTgwOWNlNTE2NGRk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB16eb7ae0) over the weekend. The NFT marketplace OpenSea, the blockchain company Polygon, and Samsung also sponsored the event along with dozens of other Web3, tech, and venture capital firms.

Lambur told Incrypto he believes the Ethereum developers can work through the bear market and economic turbulence ahead and emerge with new tech, which “most people outside of crypto would point to and be like, ‘Yeah, that’s actually kind of cool.’”—_JE_
