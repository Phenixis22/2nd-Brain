Cute date idea: We move to acquire a company in a fire sale, tweet a lot about it, back out, watch the markets burn to cinders around us, and then maybe get some ice cream? ![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/g-zeVmz64zlwugOAGXiNG0Hng-GBDlD7pMHRbQESDjRKwUy7tC8bjRsZGOX75_bZhM8oVzgajEMMj5ikaeCHkbfj6gnAgTH0EqaUel0izMNnG4ZKrBaW6u_Jg3dU8gGgvPybJr3DWwndrhrmOm6SYBc9KwtVHRiabaAd=s0-d-e1-ft#https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/soft-ice-cream_1f366.png)

-   **Markets:** Bitcoin briefly dropped below $16,000 for the first time in two years on Wednesday afternoon, while the global cryptocurrency market cap fell below $800 billion—a plunge of $200 billion from a year ago. Phew. Remember when crypto’s problem was $300,000 cartoons of monkeys?
-   **Economy:** There _are_ troubles beyond the crypto palace walls, believe it or not. US stocks plunged on Tuesday. The Russia-Ukraine War, Beijing’s zero-Covid protocols, and falling Asian markets have shaken the Chinese economy. Disney stock fell. Facebook laid off 11,000 workers. And we didn’t win the $2 billion Powerball.

On Monday, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) [tweeted](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29660877.56891/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jdXJyZW5jaWVzL2hvdy1iaW5hbmNlcy1wbGFuLWJ1eS1mdHgtdW5mb2xkZWQtbWF0dGVyLWRheXMtMjAyMi0xMS0wOC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB9e12a430), “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” Well, now he looks like the little meme dog in the burning house. On Tuesday, No. 1 crypto exchange Binance signed a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire its rival FTX. And on Wednesday…Binance called off that deal.

Now, FTX may be in deep water without the financial floaties Binance had offered. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said in his tweet on Tuesday FTX is facing a “significant liquidity crunch.” And no, “liquidity crunch” is not a new Taco Bell item. Here, it means FTX tied up too much of its money and doesn’t have enough lying around to fulfill customer withdrawals.

[A Coindesk report](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29660877.56891/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMTEvMDIvZGl2aXNpb25zLWluLXNhbS1iYW5rbWFuLWZyaWVkcy1jcnlwdG8tZW1waXJlLWJsdXItb24taGlzLXRyYWRpbmctdGl0YW4tYWxhbWVkYXMtYmFsYW5jZS1zaGVldC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB00c85e49) kicked off this whole saga when it suggested FTX’s funds are about as liquid as congealed cheese. So CZ put FTX’s liquidity to the test and sold all of Binance’s holdings of FTT, FTX’s native token. Around $530 million worth. The move may have been the last push SBF needed to make him consider a deal from Binance after he first asked several billionaires for a funding life raft, according to Semafor. (Note to self: Become friends with more billionaires.)

Presumably, after extending his offer, CZ took a look at FTX’s books and decided it was as unsalvageable as toast that fell butter-side down. And a new probe by US regulators makes it look even less appealing.

## This is Defcon 1 for the crypto industry

“The crypto industry is having a bit of an Enron moment,” Gabriella Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association, told Incrypto. PitchBook crypto analyst Robert Le said the event will shake investor confidence more than the collapses of Terra Luna, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital.

-   Investors withdrew about $6 billion from FTX during a 72-hour period before Tuesday. For context, the largest [bank run](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29660877.56891/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL3N0b3J5L3dpdGhkcmF3YWxzLWJ5LWN1c3RvbWVycy11bHRpbWF0ZWx5LXNhbmstd2FtdS1vdHM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBf852a356) in US history was when $16.7 billion was withdrawn from Washington Mutual over nine days, per MarketWatch.
-   SBF, who’s been previously called crypto’s “white knight” for bailing out other companies (the irony!), lost $14 billion of his net worth. It’s now around a measly $1 billion.

That’s just the epicenter. Tremors have also shaken Robinhood stock and the price of bitcoin.

# Hang on a minute - Here comes regulation—and in a hurry
Digital tokens falling into the Capitol building 
Francis Scialabba
Crypto was already an issue in the midterm elections. Then Binance and FTX crashed their deal-or-no-deal saga through the front windows of campaign central.

However (and whenever) the crypto crisis resolves, the red-hot issue of crypto regulation may now move forward quickly—and in a red-state way. Here’s why:

1. The biggest Dem in crypto’s been silenced. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was one of crypto’s biggest political players. He gave $40 million almost entirely to Democrats, per the WSJ. But now those contributions and that booming voice have likely lost their influence because his company is collapsing. “The downfall of FTX may discount SBF’s views but may, in fact, speed up regulation,” Northwestern professor and crypto expert Sarit Markovich told Incrypto via email.

2. The GOP may guide a reaction to the crisis. If Republicans take back the House, North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry would lead the committee overseeing the response. “I look forward to learning more from FTX and Binance,” he said on Tuesday, adding that he’s also eager to hear about “the steps they will take to protect customers.” And Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s head just exploded because she and other Democrats have been trying to keep the government from getting too cozy with the industry.

3. The legislation logjam is likely broken. Despite all the legislation that’s been put forward, Congress hasn’t passed anything substantial. That will probably change soon, and without input from SBF. A key bipartisan crypto bill was cowritten by Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who is sometimes called the “Crypto Queen” for her support of the industry. In an email, Lummis told Incrypto: “It’s important for those who are making the laws to have a deep understanding of the issues.” We asked if she believes crypto will have a comeback this year or next year, and she replied, “Absolutely.”

4. The SEC will probably be benched. Business-friendly lawmakers making progress on regulation are also likely to curb SEC chair Gary Gensler, whose enthusiastic enforcement of a crypto law broken by Kim Kardashian could’ve made TMZ paparazzi raise a Red Bull in his honor.

Bottom line: The juxtaposition of Election Night and the FTX fiasco brought regulation into the national mainstream, and now it’s on like Donkey Kong—except the donkey may have lost some kick.—JE
