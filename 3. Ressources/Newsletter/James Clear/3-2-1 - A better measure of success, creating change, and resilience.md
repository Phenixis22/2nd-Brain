## III.
```ad-quote
title: "Deconstruct the cool things you see.</br></br>If you'd like to become a better musician and you see an amazing performance, start paying attention to how they do it. How did they promote the event? What happens in the first ten seconds of each song? How frequently are they engaging directly with the audience? Is there a progression of energy throughout the show?</br></br>When something fascinates you, pay attention to the details. The person who thinks, "That was cool" is a consumer. The person who thinks, "How did they make something that cool?" is on the path to being a creator.</br></br>Don't just taste the recipe, look for the ingredients."<br>*- James Clear*
