# 3 Ideas From Me
## I.
"The observant person finds many teachers."
## II.
"Criticize to uplift, not to destroy."
## III.
"Every transaction is paid for at least three times. First, with the money you pay. Second, with the time you spend. Third, with the reputation you create through your behavior.

Being pleasant, reliable, and easy to work with might cost you a little more time. Perhaps even a bit of extra money. But the long-term returns from a great reputation usually outweigh the cost of a single transaction.

Most of the value in life and in business arises out of good relationships."

## II.
Writer, artist, and podcast host **Debbie Millman** on busyness:

"Busy is a decision. We do the things we want to do, period. If we say we are too busy, it is just shorthand for the thing being "not important enough" or "not a priority." Busy is not a badge. You don’t find the time to make things, you make the time to do things."
