```ad-quote
title: "It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it.</br> </br>If you don't want to live the lifestyle, then release yourself from the desire. To crave the result but not the process, is to guarantee disappointment."<br>*- **James Clear** *

## III.
```ad-quote
title: "Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn’t matter how good or how bad it is. You don’t need to set the world on fire with your first try. You just need to prove to yourself that you have what it takes to produce something. There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists who became great by half-finishing their work. Stop debating what you should make and just make something."<br>*- **James Clear** *
