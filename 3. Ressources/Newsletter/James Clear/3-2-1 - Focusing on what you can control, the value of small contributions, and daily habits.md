## II.
```ad-quote
title: "If you never question things, your life ends up being limited by other people's imaginations. </br> </br> Take the time to think and dream, to question and reconsider. It is better to be limited by what you can dream for yourself than by where you fit in someone else's dream."<br>*- **James Clear** *

## III.
```ad-quote
title: "The edge is in the inputs.</br> </br> The person who consumes from better sources, gets better thoughts. The person who asks better questions, gets better answers. The person who builds better habits, gets better results.</br> </br> It's not the outcomes. It's the inputs."<br>*- **James Clear** *

## II.
```ad-quote
title: "All information belongs to everybody all the time. It should be available. It should be accessible to the child, to the woman, to the man, to the old person, to the semiliterate, to the presidents of universities, to everyone. It should be open...</br></br> Information helps you to see that you’re not alone. That there’s somebody in Mississippi and somebody in Tokyo who all have wept, who’ve all longed and lost, who’ve all been happy. So the library helps you to see, not only that you are not alone, but that you’re not really any different from everyone else. There may be details that are different, but a human being is a human being."<br>*- **Maya Angelou**, author and poet, from an interview*
