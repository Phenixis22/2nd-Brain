# 2 Quotes From Others
## I.
```ad-quote
title: "Action is hope. At the end of each day, when you’ve done your work, you lie there and think, Well, I’ll be damned, I did this today. It doesn’t matter how good it is, or how bad—you did it. At the end of the week you’ll have a certain amount of accumulation. At the end of a year, you look back and say, I’ll be damned, it’s been a good year."<br>*- **Ray Bradbury**, author and screenwriter, from <u>The Art of Fiction No.203</u>*

## II.
```ad-quote
title: "My observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person. And if we really go back and we examine, you know, did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers."<br>*- **Steve Jobs**, from <u>1990 Interview</u>*

# 1 Question For You
```ad-help
title: Imagine all your responsibilities and obligations vanish overnight.</br></br>What would you miss doing? What would you choose to add back to your life?</br> </br> If you're searching for more time this year, start with a clean slate and choose what to add to your days rather than starting with a full schedule and trying to figure out what to eliminate.
