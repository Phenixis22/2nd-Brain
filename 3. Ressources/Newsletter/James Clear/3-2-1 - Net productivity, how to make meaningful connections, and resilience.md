# 3 Ideas From Me
## I.
"The ultimate form of preparation is not planning for a specific scenario, but a mindset that can handle uncertainty."
## II.
"In some areas of life, value is unlocked by starting. Even a five-minute workout or a short walk can reset your mood and benefit your body.

In other areas, value is unlocked by finishing. It does you no good to build a bridge halfway across the river. You need to complete the project to realize the value.

Do you need to start or finish? Are you building a body or building a bridge?"
## III.
"Your net productivity is the balance of the productive and unproductive forces in your life.

A great deal of time and energy is spent thinking about how to increase effort, but there is a lot to be gained by reducing friction.

A car will travel faster not only if you press the accelerator, but also if you remove the speed bumps."
