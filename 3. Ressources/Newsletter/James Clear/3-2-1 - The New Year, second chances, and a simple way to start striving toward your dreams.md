title: "You can graduate with the finest degrees. You can read the most useful books. You can enjoy the loving support of family and friends.</br></br>But your degrees can't take action for you. Your books can't make the decision for you. Your family can't live your life for you.</br></br>There is no substitute for courage. At some point, you have to make the choice."<br>*- James Clear*
