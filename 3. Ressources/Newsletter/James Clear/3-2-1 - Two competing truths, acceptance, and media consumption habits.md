# 3 Ideas From Me

## I.

"Two competing truths:

- The more prepared person usually wins.

- You get credit for action, not preparation."

## II.

"What appears to be a rapid shift is often preceded by a gradual process. Our results gradually explode or vanish thanks to the small habits we repeat each day.

What radical change are you slowly marching toward? An incremental explosion or an incremental vanishing?"

## III.

"One type of person approaches a situation with the mindset of, “How can I make this work?”

Another type seems to approach each circumstance with the mindset of, “What are all the reasons this wouldn’t work?”

Both people will be forced to deal with reality, but the first person will only have to solve problems that actually occur while the second person will often avoid taking action entirely because of the potential problems they have dreamt up before starting.

There will always be reasons to not do something. Be a problem solver, not a problem adder."
