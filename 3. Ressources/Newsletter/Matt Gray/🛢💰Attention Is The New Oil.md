In a recent Alex Hormozi podcast I was listening to, he said, **“attention is the new oil.”** 

He goes on to say that in the 20th century, billionaires were made through the oil industry.

But in the 21st century, it will be content creators with an audience that will become billionaires.

Although I haven’t been able to describe it quite as eloquently, I have seen this shift as well.

That's why I’ve gone hard into building my own personal brand this past year.

And thanks to the content empire strategy I’ve implemented, I’ve seen my own audience grow by 400,000 in just 9 months.

Since I believe that building an audience will be the single most impactful thing you can do in 2023, in today’s newsletter, I want to share 6 tips for growing your following.

Apply them, and you’re all but guaranteed to grow a nice size following of raving fans in the year to come.

# Invent a category and own it
In today’s digital age you MUST stand out. Otherwise, you’ll never be found.

The easiest way to stand out is to invent your own category.

In the words of David Sacks, **"The one who defines the category wins the category."**

Define your category in 2-4 clear words, and then run with it.
# Leverage Content To Create A Loyal Community
_“If you build it they will come”_ might be a great strategy for a baseball stadium, but it’s terrible advice for anyone trying to build an audience.

To get attention you need to be in front of your ideal audience, and regularly.

**I recommend picking 2 social media platforms to begin with, and committing to publish 2x daily.**

Focus on content that:

-   Inspires 
-   Educates 
-   Entertains 
-   Makes people think 
-   Triggers some sort of emotion

# Follow the Data
Numbers don't lie.

After you’ve been consistently posting for a little while, it’s important to take some time and look over your data.

You’ll start to see trends around what resonates with your audience. 

Double down on what’s working, and do less of what isn’t.

**Execute, optimize, repeat.**
# Obsess over copywriting
**Copywriting is a salesperson that never sleeps.**

**8.25 seconds** = average human attention span

**80% of your post is the first sentence.** If people don’t get hooked in immediately, they won’t keep reading.

Make sure your copy is A+.

# Design Is A Superpower
“A picture is worth a thousand words.”

The only thing more important than good copy is a good design.

Great design communicates professionalism and authority, and helps build trust with your audience.

Bad design can confuse your audience, or make you lose credibility. _And we don’t want either of those._

# Stories Are Your Secret Weapon
**"The mistake people make is thinking the story is just about marketing. No, the story is the strategy. If you make your story better, you make your strategy better." - Ben Horowitz**

People don’t connect with brands. They connect with people.

This works in two ways.

First, your own story is a powerful tool for drawing in your ideal audience.

Second, when you tell stories in your content, the stories naturally captivate your audience and help deepen the connection they have with you.

Use stories as much as you can.
