Since the beginning of this month, companies including Meta, Amazon, Lyft, Twitter, Stripe, and Salesforce have all jumped on the pink slip bandwagon, cutting thousands of jobs in total.

The cost-cutting moves come as a reaction to slowed growth in the tech sector, per the¬†[Wall Street Journal](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90ZWNoLWJvb20tZW5kcy1hcy1jb21wYW5pZXMtZnJvbS1hbWF6b24tdG8tbWV0YS1hZGp1c3QtdG8tdHVyYnVsZW50LXRpbWVzLTExNjY2OTU3Nzg5P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB5ee13209)¬†and other media outlets, as revenue growth stalls and consumers switch spending from goods to services. Tech executives, such as Meta CEO¬†[Mark Zuckerberg](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly9hYm91dC5mYi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzExL21hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1sYXlvZmYtbWVzc2FnZS10by1lbXBsb3llZXMvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB276f2821), have also cited macroeconomic conditions like inflation and high interest rates.

But some economists disagree. Payroll company ADP‚Äôs chief economist Nela Richardson told the Washington Post that layoffs in high-profile companies are just a byproduct of quirky scenarios‚Äîthink Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter takeover and Meta‚Äôs messy go at AI.

_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._

Black Friday is around the corner, and if you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôre bracing for some¬†[bad decisions](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1CR05ra1ZySlprcw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efD416ad85b). But here‚Äôs the thing: We can treat ourselves after this dumpster fire of a year without letting seasonal sales get the best of us. So I‚Äôm inviting you to join me in some holiday shopping¬†‚ú®mindfulness¬†‚ú®that will spare you the fat credit card bill, the drawers full of clutter, and the deep regret that comes with impulse shopping.

The biggest rule to follow this Black Friday (say it with me, y‚Äôall):¬†**Don‚Äôt buy it if you wouldn‚Äôt get it without a markdown**. If you wouldn‚Äôt buy a puffy purple polo match hat at full price, why do you need it at a 70% discount? Would you even be happy if you got it as a gift? Nope. Chuck it outta your cart.

On the other hand, retailers have¬†_a lot_¬†of stuff they want to¬†[get rid of](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYWN5cy1tLXEzLWVhcm5pbmdzLXJlcG9ydC0yMDIzLTExNjY4Njg4NTkyP21vZD1TZWFyY2hyZXN1bHRzX3BvczEmcGFnZT0x/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB4d9230fe), because the presently healthy supply chain, higher prices, and inflation expectations resulted in increased inventory before sales season‚Ä¶by a lot. So, while discounts might be extra attractive this week, and worth taking advantage of, focus on things you need (and holiday gifts). Get some blinders if you gotta, so you stick¬†_only_¬†to those purchases.

To find the best deals and make sure what you‚Äôre buying is worth the price tag, consult product review sources like¬†[Wirecutter](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vd2lyZWN1dHRlci8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB841ec5e6)¬†and never go for a deal on social media without first browsing around for something better.

**Our bottom line:**¬†Put in the work to find the best deals, and see discounts as an opportunity to spend¬†_less_¬†on things you need or already meant to buy rather than an opportunity to buy¬†_more_. In this economic climate, your emergency fund will thank you.¬†üõçÔ∏è‚Äî_Isabel_

Man, I love a little treat. At my worst, I cannot leave the house without purchasing a $12 bag of artisanal pasta or a novelty oven mitt. Can I afford these things? Absolutely not. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve implemented what I call the Little Treat List. If you struggle with¬†_over_-treating yourself like me,¬†**the smart move is to make a physical list of coveted items and walk away.**

I keep my Little Treat List in my Notes app. It‚Äôs a running list of items I very, very much want to buy. I get served an Instagram ad for a gorgeous cutting board; I add it to the list. I see an $80 candle the size of my head; onto the list it goes.

The list serves a few purposes: First, it allows me to step away and clear my head. (More than once, I‚Äôve reviewed the list and realized that I actually do not need the Michelin Man-inspired¬†[puffer pajamas](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FZGRpZS1CYXVlci1FZGRpZXMtQWxkZXItWC1MYXJnZS9kcC9CMEJLSk4zTEdUL3JlZj1hc2NfZGZfQjBCS0pOM0xHVC8_dGFnPWh5cHJvZC0yMCZsaW5rQ29kZT1kZjAmaHZhZGlkPTYzNDE1MzE0NzE5NCZodnBvcz0maHZuZXR3PWcmaHZyYW5kPTE2OTIyODkzMzcyMjQzNjUyNzk4Jmh2cG9uZT0maHZwdHdvPSZodnFtdD0maHZkZXY9YyZodmR2Y21kbD0maHZsb2NpbnQ9Jmh2bG9jcGh5PTkwMjE3NDMmaHZ0YXJnaWQ9cGxhLTE4ODQ4ODYyNTk5ODkmcHNjPTE/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB5b12604d).)

Second, it allows me to spend more intentionally. If I get an unexpected windfall‚Äîsome birthday cash here, a holiday bonus there‚ÄîI can review the list and choose something I know I‚Äôll really enjoy.¬†[Shame-free spending](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL21vbmV5LXNjb29wL3N0b3JpZXMvc3BlbmRpbmctd2l0aG91dC1ndWlsdD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3Jm1pZD0yMzBkZjcwMjQ3ZDk2NjZkMDM0MDk4MDljZTUxNjRkZA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd063c04e), here I come.

Hard or soft? No, it's not what your gutter mind is thinking‚Äîit‚Äôs what economists are debating in regard to what kind of landing we‚Äôll face as the Fed handles inflation.

The latest inflation numbers are looking¬†[a bit better](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzEwL2Vjb25vbXkvY3BpLWluZmxhdGlvbi1yZXBvcnQtb2N0b2Jlcj91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB24c56c8d)¬†than expected (7.7% versus the expected 8%), so a soft landing looks not so out of reach. Jobless claims and unemployment are¬†[good](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9lY29ub215L2Zld2VyLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1maWxlZC1mb3Itam9ibGVzcy1iZW5lZml0cy1sYXN0LXdlZWstY29udHJpYnV0aW5nLXRvLWluZmxhdGlvbj91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBee37142b), too, with claims falling by 4,000 from 226,000 to 222,000 as of Nov. 12. But if you‚Äôre in the wonky world of econ, these jobs numbers are actually¬†[bad signs](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9kb3VnYm9uZXBhcnRoL3N0YXR1cy8xNTQ1MzkxMDUwOTMxNTM1ODc0P3M9MjAmdD1ReXBKMW1UMXNiVU5fQV9CLXFUMEFR/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6ef27ae5).

And yet, you could still lose your job because of it.

A wage-price spiral occurs when there‚Äôs a feedback loop between high inflation and wage increases. In theory, as inflation increases, workers ask for more pay, their bosses give it to them, and then the workers spend more with this higher income, making prices rise.

But the 2023¬†[pay raise expectation](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L3N1Y2Nlc3Mvc2FsYXJ5LXJhaXNlcy0yMDIzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB97506d5b)¬†is 4.6%, which isn‚Äôt enough to overcome inflation. So in real (not nominal) terms, most workers should expect a pay¬†_cut_. Oof.

Per CBS News, the Fed projected that the unemployment rate would increase to 4.4% next year because of the continued rate hikes, which equates to an estimated 1.2 million people losing their jobs.

If the unemployment rate rises, job seekers aren‚Äôt likely to¬†[get enough assistance](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9wb2xpY3ktYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMTAvMjYvMjM0MTkzNzMvaW5mbGF0aW9uLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1pbnRlcmVzdC1yYXRlcy1lY29ub215P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB4c4ef07b). After all, the Covid-19 stimulus checks are often blamed for causing inflation. And while the effects of inflation are regressive, a rise in unemployment will hurt groups that are already economically disadvantaged.

So make sure your¬†[r√©sum√© stands out](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29779048.313373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0zcF9Oa0hlcXdJTQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efE8a0360c3)¬†and reach out to our pal Jermone Powell to see if he‚Äôll give you a letter of rec.
