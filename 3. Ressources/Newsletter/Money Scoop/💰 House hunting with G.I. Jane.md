# Excel dictionnary - Excel around the world
_Formulas, shortcuts, and other hot spreadsheet tips._
Planning a European trip soon and hoping to learn the basics? Excel can actually help! I can just imagine your confused face, but it‚Äôs true. Instead of wasting time Googling basic info like a country‚Äôs language or currency, Excel can do the searching for you with a nifty tool called¬†**Data Types**.

A data type is a value linked to an online data source that allows you to pull¬†_real-time_¬†data into your worksheet. In the example above, we have a list of countries. To pull each country‚Äôs language, currency, and flag into the worksheet, you first need to convert the countries into data types. To do this, select the text, navigate to Data > Data Types. For this example, you‚Äôll select the Geography data type. Then the text will convert, and you‚Äôll see a map icon in front of each value in the Country column.

Now, pull the information directly into your worksheet by hitting the ‚Äúinsert data‚Äù icon and selecting the field you want to add to each subsequent column of your data table.

Once you‚Äôve selected the field for all your columns, you can just kick back and hit the refresh button anytime to keep your data up-to-date!

# Stack it up - Recon on VA loans
_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._
Military service is often a lifelong commitment for both service members and their families, so the least Daddy Government can do is help them score affordable housing. Veteran‚Äôs Day got us thinking about our soldiers, so today we‚Äôre talking about VA loans, which started with the original¬†[1944 GI Bill](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZW5lZml0cy52YS5nb3YvSE9NRUxPQU5TL2dpYmlsbF83NS5hc3A_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBddc0ddb8).

To get a VA loan, prospective borrowers need to meet the minimum¬†[active-duty requirements](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmEuZ292L2hvdXNpbmctYXNzaXN0YW5jZS9ob21lLWxvYW5zL2VsaWdpYmlsaXR5Lz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBbcbb21e0)¬†and¬†[agree to live in the house](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292bG9hbnMuZ292L2xvYW5zL2hvbWUtbG9hbi1mb3ItcmVndWxhci1wdXJjaGFzZS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd3514c4c)¬†they‚Äôre purchasing. They also have to snag a certificate of eligibility, shop around for a private lender since they‚Äôre not borrowing directly from the government, and‚Ä¶find a house (which may be difficult in the¬†[current climate](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI5LzEwODkxNzQ2MzAvaG91c2luZy1zaG9ydGFnZS1uZXctaG9tZS1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBa9353918)).

-   **No down payment required.**¬†Service members and veterans can put money down if they want to, but unlike conventional mortgages, the Department of Veterans Affairs will reimburse the lender if the home is foreclosed. This means loans can be accepted without a down payment. However, remember that private lenders may have different rules.
-   **Low interest rates.**¬†The CFPB has an¬†[interest rate estimator](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uc3VtZXJmaW5hbmNlLmdvdi9vd25pbmctYS1ob21lL2V4cGxvcmUtcmF0ZXMvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB5512685b)¬†that can help prospective borrowers see what interest rates private lenders may be willing to offer based on credit score, state, house price, and down payment percentage (make sure to select ‚ÄúVA‚Äù as the loan type in the drop-down menu).
-   **Limited closing costs.**¬†The VA¬†[requires the seller](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmEuZ292L2hvdXNpbmctYXNzaXN0YW5jZS9ob21lLWxvYW5zL2Z1bmRpbmctZmVlLWFuZC1jbG9zaW5nLWNvc3RzLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3I290aGVyLWxvYW4tY2xvc2luZy1jb3N0cw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB45ab1966)¬†to pay at least some of the closing costs. The buyer can also negotiate to have the seller pay other closing costs, like the VA funding fee.

-   **VA loans can be used repeatedly.**¬†But taking out loans for new properties can complicate the process or make it more expensive.

Current estimates indicate there are over 13,000¬†[unsheltered veterans](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29693247.324328/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVkLmdvdi9wcmVzcy9wcmVzc19yZWxlYXNlc19tZWRpYV9hZHZpc29yaWVzL0hVRF9Ob18yMl8yMjc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB657f7167)¬†in the US.
