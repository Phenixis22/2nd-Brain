## **32%**

According to Bankrate, [32% of Gen Zers and millennials](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFua3JhdGUuY29tL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvaG9saWRheS1zaG9wcGluZy1wcmVzc3VyZXMteW91bmctYW1lcmljYW5zLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB70c76f2b) are planning to pay off a credit card over time or use a buy now, pay later service to finance their holiday shopping (compared to 24% of Gen Xers and baby boomers). So unless you want your bank account to experience Christmas in July, go easy on the swiping this season.

## **$30,600**

’Tis the season of giving, and many well-heeled adults in the US are pulling out their wallets to support a cause (and lower their tax bill). SmartAsset found that the average rich American earning upwards of $200,000 deducts around [$30,600 in donations](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly9zbWFydGFzc2V0LmNvbS9kYXRhLXN0dWRpZXMvd2hlcmUtcmljaC1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZ2l2ZS10aGUtbW9zdC10by1jaGFyaXR5LTIwMjI_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6c354b82).

## **43%**

Alliant Credit Union emailed Money Scoop some brand-new findings: Apparently, 43% of millennials expect to receive an inheritance, and over half expect _at least_ $350,000. Who’s gonna tell them that half of the baby boomers only plan to leave $250,000? The math isn’t mathing. 😬
# Jargon Slayer
I get nauseous easily, which means roller coasters aren’t my cup of tea. Same goes for speedboat rides, hilly drives, and ultra-risky investing. That last one can be nauseating in more ways than one, sometimes leading to what investors call the “puke point.” **But what _is_ the so-called [puke point](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW52ZXN0b3BlZGlhLmNvbS90ZXJtcy9wL3B1a2UuYXNwP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcjOn46dGV4dD1UaGUlMjBwb2ludCUyMGF0JTIwd2hpY2glMjBhbixmb3IlMjBhJTIwbW9yZSUyMHByb2ZpdGFibGUlMjB2ZW50dXJl/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBc50207aa)?**

The term applies to assets that are rapidly plummeting in value. You know when you hit a big drop on a roller coaster and your stomach feels like it’s flying out of your butt? It’s like that but with investing.

When you’ve hit your personal puke point, it means you can no longer deal with an asset’s significant losses. To avoid further losses, you decide to sell…at a loss. A _big_ loss. *Cue puking sound.* 🤢

Remember last month when Meta stock [got lower](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8yNy9tZXRhLXN0b2NrLWZhbGxzLTIzcGVyY2VudC1vbi1lYXJuaW5ncy1taXNzLWFuYWx5c3QtZG93bmdyYWRlcy5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBcdff6576) than [Lil Jon](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1JWUg3X0d6UDRUZw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBba23a5e3)? That may have been a puke point for some. Here’s the thing: Everybody’s puke point is different. In theme park terms, I can barely handle a log flume ride—but someone else may be able to chug a Mountain Dew Big Gulp before hopping on [Kingda Ka](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1KNWh3NFhCVEZlbw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efC6ae1bc9d).

Similarly, if you have a low puke point, you might shimmy away at the first sign of peril. If you have a high puke point, you’re probably more tolerant of risk. Either way, if you see losses, ask yourself: Can I handle a little tummy trouble?_—Lillian_

_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._

Severance. A word that earlier this year just made us think about that [freaky show](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj14RVFQNFZWdXlyWQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efD4c3298a0) on Apple TV+ (can’t wait for season two 🍿). But now, as layoffs abound and economic uncertainty reigns, severance is top of mind for many facing unemployment and job hunting.

While it would be nice for every employer to offer severance packages, this practice is [not federally mandated](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXJsYXd5ZXIuY29tL3NldmVyYW5jZS1wYXktbGF3cy1ieS1zdGF0ZS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldyM6fjp0ZXh0PUNhbGlmb3JuaWElMkMlMjBDb2xvcmFkbyUyQyUyMEhhd2FpaSUyQyUyMElsbGlub2lzLHNldmVyYW5jZSUyMGJlZm9yZSUyMHRoZSUyMG5leHQlMjBwYXlkYXku/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB22b92fdb). Companies that _do_ offer severance pay typically set a standard for the number of weeks they’ll pay after layoffs (for example, two weeks of paid salary for every year of employment). Payments may either go out periodically like a regular paycheck or be paid in a lump sum.

So if you’re offered a severance package, read through it carefully so you know what’s coming and don’t be afraid to [negotiate](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3ctdG8tbmVnb3RpYXRlLWEtYmV0dGVyLXNldmVyYW5jZS1wYWNrYWdlLWlmLXlvdS1hcmUtYmVpbmctbGFpZC1vZmYtMTE2MDgxNTI2MTA_bW9kPWFydGljbGVfaW5saW5l/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB53213824)—you’ve got nothing to lose. A few things to keep in mind:

-   **Severance is taxed like regular income.** That’s why getting a lump-sum payout can be a double-edged sword. You get the cash straight away, but a big payout could land you in a [higher tax bracket](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW52ZXN0b3BlZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9wZi8wOC9uZWdvdGlhdGluZy1zZXZlcmFuY2UtYWdyZWVtZW50cy5hc3A_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB9b8111f2)…and nobody wants that.
-   **There’s more to severance packages than pay.** Offers define future terms of benefits like health, life, and disability insurance. Your employer could extend your benefits for a specific period of time, or you might have to switch to [COBRA](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29icmFpbnN1cmFuY2UuY29tLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB33624b64) insurance (plans average between $400 and $700 a month). [Marketplace plans](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmFsYW5jZW1vbmV5LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtaW5zdXJhbmNlLW9wdGlvbnMtd2hlbi15b3UtbG9zZS1hLWpvYi0yMDYzNDA4P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcjdG9jLWhvdy10by1kcm9wLWNvYnJhLWZvci1hLW1hcmtldHBsYWNlLXBsYW4/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBf7064b7d) usually offer better prices, but coverage may be limited and might not include your regular medical providers.
-   **Unemployment benefits can be tricky.** [In some states](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29827363.321903/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmFsYW5jZW1vbmV5LmNvbS9ob3ctZG9lcy1zZXZlcmFuY2UtYW5kLXZhY2F0aW9uLXBheS1hZmZlY3QtdW5lbXBsb3ltZW50LTIwNjQxOTA_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB802f705c), you won’t be eligible to receive government unemployment benefits unless you remain unemployed _beyond_ your severance period or if your severance pay is below a certain amount. But in other states, like California, laid-off workers qualify for benefits no matter what.

Although a layoff can feel emotional, remember it’s not a blemish on your résumé. You’ll often hear that the decision to let an employee go is not personal. But you know what _is_ personal? Your severance package. So advocate hard for yourself if you get the dreaded pink slip. 🥊_—Isabel_
