_Your weekly serving of surprising, bite-size intel._

Finally, justice for the most underrated holiday food: _cranberries_. Retail [data](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrZXRuZXdzLnVzZGEuZ292L21ucC9kYXRhRG93bmxvYWQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB48dae28b) from USDA Market News shows the little red fruit may be inflation-proof. The Balance [evaluated](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmFsYW5jZW1vbmV5LmNvbS90dXJrZXktYW5kLXBvdGF0b2VzLWNvc3QtMTctcGVyY2VudC1tb3JlLXRoaXMtdGhhbmtzZ2l2aW5nLTY3NTQ0Nzk_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBc9c8a426) the data and found that the cost of cranberries held steady over the last year, chillin’ around $2.50 per 12-ounce bag. That’s about 8% cheaper than last year when you adjust for inflation!

Meanwhile, turkey is about 17% more expensive this year at about $2.50 per pound, or $75 big bucks for a 30-pound bird. I guess you could say the cranberries are…[letting it linger](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HNktzcGozT08wcw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB8b3c9cca). Please excuse my extremely bad Dolores O’Riordan pun; I’m very busy planning a string of cranberry-forward holiday meals. ![](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/vNT1E0WUpgy5B8MSIPtTepm7PNvJUBrR8JkzjS6QBlFdqij_k49wBbR3pfRehIEdQBrbVYmqef87XWgT5bAXs4WSIojm8etCZwFhHk-huDZRPeihyPCR0OTa_7mwxRgxAk-SrQxqrPYsnRy_SxLWp7dgGsM5XvA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/clown-face_1f921.png)_—Lillian_

_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._
I attended five—count ’em—_five_ weddings this year, several of which were nontraditional. As in, _hot dog bars and karaoke_. As in, _defying heteronormative ideas_. As in…_this ain’t your grandma’s wedding_.

It got me thinking: Marriage has obviously changed a lot since our grandparents’ time, and that includes the financial side, too. A [CreditCards.com poll](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3JlZGl0Y2FyZHMuY29tL3N0YXRpc3RpY3MvZmluYW5jaWFsLWluZmlkZWxpdHktY2hlYXRpbmctcG9sbC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBc851f28f) found 14% of married baby boomers keep their money separate, compared to 45% of younger millennials (ages 26 to 32). As more couples opt to [keep their finances separate](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL21vbmV5LXNjb29wL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMS8wOS8wOS9zcGxpdC1leHBlbnNlcy1wYXJ0bmVyP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcmbWlkPTIzMGRmNzAyNDdkOTY2NmQwMzQwOTgwOWNlNTE2NGRk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBc8ecbf9e), is there still an argument to combine them?

The data says yes. One frequently cited [paper](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly9wc3ljbmV0LmFwYS5vcmcvcmVjb3JkLzIwMjItNDI5NjItMDAxP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB2860efff) found that couples who pool their funds “experience greater relationship satisfaction compared to couples who keep all (or some) of their money separate.” That same paper noted “significant interaction between account pooling and the duration of the couple’s relationship.”

But this is Money Scoop, and we’re troublemakers, so we’re obviously going to approach this data with a skeptical eye. Pooling money may not be a good idea for couples who have mismatched spending habits. This is especially tricky when, say, one person has a lot of debt to pay off and the other is debt-free. Also, when couples don’t bring in comparable salaries, there could be underlying resentment about splitting living costs 50-50.

And while the conclusion of this study is optimistic about sharing money, the idea is predicated on equal partners that trust and respect each other—or else the arrangement could lead to financial abuse. For example, [one study](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVzZWFyY2hnYXRlLm5ldC9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbi8yMzU2NTc5MjRfVGhlX0ltcGFjdF9vZl9JbnRpbWF0ZV9QYXJ0bmVyX1Zpb2xlbmNlX29uX0xvdy1JbmNvbWVfV29tZW4nc19FY29ub21pY19XZWxsLUJlaW5nX1RoZV9NZWRpYXRpbmdfUm9sZV9vZl9Kb2JfU3RhYmlsaXR5P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB48ddb5b3) found that economic abuse occurs in as many as 99% of domestic violence cases. Think of it this way: When pooling money goes wrong and one person surrenders their money to a so-called joint account they don’t have free access to, it’s a slippery slope to financial dependence. There’s a subtle but important difference between equal partners pooling money versus a financial power imbalance.

Ultimately, there are significant pros and cons to combining finances with your boo. Try planning regular [money dates](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL21vbmV5LXNjb29wL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8wNC8xOS9hLWd1aWRlLXRvLXlvdXItZmlyc3QtbW9uZXktZGF0ZT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3Jm1pZD0yMzBkZjcwMjQ3ZDk2NjZkMDM0MDk4MDljZTUxNjRkZA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB8372d040) with your partner to figure out what’s best for you. They can boost feelings of financial togetherness, which is never a bad thing._—Lillian_

_What this day in history means for your financial life now._

As they say, teamwork makes the dream (of having a decent amount of wealth) work. However, historically speaking, the extremely affluent haven’t always been thrilled when poor people band together. Case in point: Take the [Wilmington coup and massacre](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1MVlFvbWxYTWVlaw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efCc969c79e) of November 10, 1898, which was the only successful coup d’etat in United States history.

Pre-insurrection Wilmington was home to many successful Black entrepreneurs. Black people held elected positions and worked in all major areas of the local economy. But after the coup, Black businesses suffered and Black people were limited to “lower-status jobs.”

The violence was in response to political cooperation: Low-income white populists and Black Republicans had formed a “[fusion](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly9leGhpYml0cy5saWIudW5jLmVkdS9leGhpYml0cy9zaG93LzE4OTgvaGlzdG9yeT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB180f5aea)” party that promised to fight for working-class constituents of all races. The party’s success in the 1894 election proved the cooperation worked.

To stop the fusion party, however, the conservative Democratic party fueled racist attitudes (this was obvi before the so-called [Southern strategy](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL291dGxvb2svMjAxOS8wNy8yNi93aGF0LXdlLWdldC13cm9uZy1hYm91dC1zb3V0aGVybi1zdHJhdGVneS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBae18e8e3)). Conservatives hoped it would bring poor white people back to their party, despite disinterest in actually addressing this demographic’s economic concerns. Tensions escalated until white supremacists ultimately overthrew the democratically elected government.

So if you’re struggling to build generational wealth, don’t forget that many economic disparities we see today are a long time in the making in this country. And while singing [kumbaya](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29661196.320241/aHR0cHM6Ly9zbGF0ZS5jb20vaHVtYW4taW50ZXJlc3QvMjAxNi8wMy9ob3cta3VtYmF5YS13ZW50LWZyb20tYW1lcmljYW4tc29uZ2Jvb2stc3RhcGxlLXRvLWEtc3ltYm9sLW9mLW5haXZlLXNtdWctdXRvcGlhbmlzbS5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB27bf4817) together might elicit some giggles, the only way to produce wealth broadly is working _together_—and with people unlike ourselves. Otherwise, we're doomed to repeat history._—Myriam_
