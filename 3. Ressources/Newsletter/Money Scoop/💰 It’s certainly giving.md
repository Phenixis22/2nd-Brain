But that leaves one question: When¬†_is_¬†retirement?

For the average worker in the US, the magic age is 65‚Äîup from 62 in 2001, according to a¬†[report](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVpLm9yZy9yZXNlYXJjaC1wcm9kdWN0cy9yZXBvcnQvdGhlLWF2ZXJhZ2UtdXMtcmV0aXJlbWVudC1hZ2UtaW5jcmVhc2VkLW92ZXItdGhlLXBhc3QtMzAteWVhcnMvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd620cd06)¬†published earlier this year by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). In 2019, a quarter of the population was still working at 70, while another quarter had already waved goodbye to work in their mid-50s. (But many retirees returned to the workforce in 2022‚Äî[1.7 million](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c25hdGlvbm5vdy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJlLW9sZGVyLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1yZXR1cm5pbmctdG8tdGhlLXdvcmtmb3JjZS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldyM6fjp0ZXh0PVRoZSUyMHVucmV0aXJlbWVudCUyMHJhdGUlMjBoYXMlMjBib3VuY2VkLGF0JTIwSW5kZWVkJTJDJTIwZXhwbGFpbmVkJTIwb24lMjBUd2l0dGVyLg/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB8a7c8a83)¬†to be exact.)

The pandemic spurred a temporary reversal in the late retirement trend, as office shutdowns and health risks led fewer retirees to reenter the workforce in 2020 and 2021. But even with that, the average age of retirement has risen since the turn of the 21st century‚Äîa stat that holds true regardless¬†of gender or level of education, per AEI‚Äôs report.

Economists have rallied behind the trend, especially as life expectancy has¬†[increased](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL2RjLW1kLXZhLzIwMjIvMTEvMTkvam9lLWJpZGVuLTgwLXdvcmtlcnMvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBa90b6bf1)¬†and the population has grown. To them, would-be retirees working longer means a bigger labor force‚Äîand more contributions to social security. But the workers laboring well into their 70s or 80s out of financial necessity would probably rather be retired on a sunny island somewhere.¬†![üèñ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3d6/32.png)‚Äî_Ethan_
# Stack it up - Put your crypto toward a good cause
_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._
There are¬†_many_¬†options out there for anyone who wants to support charitable organizations on Giving Tuesday. Some people will give a one-time monetary gift while others set up recurring monthly donations (organizations tend to prefer this kind of giving for monthly budgeting purposes). You might also consider volunteering or making an in-kind donation of clothing, furniture, or other gently used items. Or, you can¬†[donate cryptocurrency](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8wOC8zMS9ob3ctY3J5cHRvLWlzLWNoYW5naW5nLXBoaWxhbnRocm9weT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3Jm1pZD0yMzBkZjcwMjQ3ZDk2NjZkMDM0MDk4MDljZTUxNjRkZA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB558297f6).

Why do people donate crypto? Isn‚Äôt the whole point to, like, HODL until the value of your investment reaches moon-level heights? Well, we‚Äôre not advising you to sell your crypto at a loss‚Äîwe‚Äôre suggesting that if your investment has appreciated and you want to give back, there are more organizations than you might think that would appreciate a crypto gift.

(And as a bonus, when you donate crypto, you might end up with a¬†[bigger tax break](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVnaXZpbmdibG9jay5jb20vcmVzb3VyY2VzL2NyeXB0by10YXgtc3Vydml2YWwtZ3VpZGUvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBae8f32c1)¬†than you would when you donate cash.)

The IRS considers digital assets like cryptocurrency as property, which means you can deduct the fair market value of the property on your taxes‚Äîjust like if you donated a car, for example. And when you donate your crypto rather than sell it, you may avoid paying¬†[capital gains tax](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL21vbmV5LXNjb29wL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8wNi8xNC9pbnZlc3RtZW50LXRheGVzLW5iZD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3Jm1pZD0yMzBkZjcwMjQ3ZDk2NjZkMDM0MDk4MDljZTUxNjRkZA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB94efa289)¬†on some of your crypto investment growth (woo-hoo!).

When you work through a crypto donation platform, you can quickly and securely pass your cryptocurrency along to one of the thousands of nonprofits eager to put it to good use‚Äîincluding big name organizations like the¬†[NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVnaXZpbmdibG9jay5jb20vZG9uYXRlL25hcmFsLXByby1jaG9pY2UtYW1lcmljYS1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBa66a6bb6),¬†[Feeding America](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVnaXZpbmdibG9jay5jb20vZG9uYXRlL2ZlZWRpbmctYW1lcmljYS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB539bca09), and the¬†[National Black Chamber of Commerce](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVnaXZpbmdibG9jay5jb20vZG9uYXRlL25hdGlvbmFsLWJsYWNrLWNoYW1iZXItb2YtY29tbWVyY2UvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB1c4e1244).

By donating some of the growth you‚Äôve received on your crypto investments, you‚Äôll also become part of a growing group of young crypto philanthropists‚Äîmany of whom are financially savvy and ready to make major contributions to the world. Whether you got into crypto because you believe in the power of decentralized currency or you bought crypto for its investment potential, you probably understand there are plenty of opportunities to generate value through cryptocurrency‚Äîand just as many ways to share that value with others.

According to The Giving Block, crypto donors reportedly contributed about¬†[$400 million](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.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)¬†in cryptocurrency to charities and nonprofits in 2021. (Of that amount, $69 million was processed through The Giving Block, with the average donation coming out to $10,455.) But if you don‚Äôt have that much to give, don‚Äôt let that stop you‚Äîevery donation makes a difference, and so does every bitcoin. ‚Çø‚Äî_Nicole Dieker, Money Scoop guest columnist_
# Smart move - Real ones only
_Actionable tips to brighten your financial future._
Maybe you‚Äôve outlined beneficiaries in your will. Or maybe you‚Äôve asked your sister to donate your retirement savings to beagle rescue charities in the case of your untimely passing. (Just me?) Either way, if you have money stashed in a retirement account,¬†**the smart move is to double-check your beneficiaries.**

Haven‚Äôt decided who gets your cash if you,¬†_ahem_, croak_?_¬†Take five minutes, and do it right now! You don‚Äôt even need a formal will because many online account management services make it wildly easy. Just indicate a beneficiary, confirm that they‚Äôre a willing recipient, and enter their information into your account profile. (You‚Äôll probably need their Social Security number.)

One caveat: In most cases, your designated account beneficiaries¬†[supersede your will](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29840409.321085/aHR0cHM6Ly90cnVzdGFuZHdpbGwuY29tL2xlYXJuL2JlbmVmaWNpYXJ5LWRlc2lnbmF0aW9uLXZzLXdpbGw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB23832806). So if you‚Äôve entered your brother‚Äôs information into your 401(k) account but listed your nephew as your 401(k) beneficiary in¬†your will, your brother will most likely get the cash. (If you really want to have some fun, get your brother on the phone and let him know that his beneficiary status is in jeopardy. Better shell out for a nice holiday gift, bub_._)_‚ÄîLillian_

But the Giving Pledge isn‚Äôt legally binding, and the promised amount doesn‚Äôt have to go to a specific cause or charity. The hope was that the fuzziness would encourage more billionaires to join.
