In this edition of Ridiculously Fancy Travel news, Lufthansa Airlines recently provided a [sneak peek](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL25ld3Nyb29tL3JlbGVhc2VzL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1vZmZlcnMtc3VpdGUtY29uY2VwdC1pbi1maXJzdC1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3MtZm9yLXRoZS1maXJzdC10aW1lLmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB632624f6) into its new first-class travel suites. Each suite features a seat that converts into a “large, comfortable bed,” as well as “nearly ceiling-high walls that can be closed for privacy.”

The suites also come complete with a personal wardrobe, so you have space to put away your airport clothes after you change into your complimentary _Lufthansa first-class pajamas_. Or, y’know, a ball gown.

No word yet on when tickets will be available for these seats, which is fine. It’ll take me at least a decade to save up enough miles to score those sweet, sweet airplane PJs._—Lillian_

_Contextualizing the finance news you need to know._

Earlier this year, my friend—we’ll call her Cassandra—spent a few days in the hospital battling what she thought was an infected cat scratch. (Turns out, she’s just allergic to Neosporin. ![](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6UQYuSxXexc_gsx2i9dQajAa7oMHZuYgUHH418sJ1P59g2zT0pwJjHYuFK2z11CLnB3fKEP8CnSGph_QvubwSPGgvCUxtNMv21ZOtwPVEO0yc17CSAl6ALRdz6u7IYLs36yEqEOeNijo7GBahmDsIkvvpaNHpIaEK6qyez2l2Jb1t-BMJQFbCOMiRY6rAz6mOA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/face-with-uneven-eyes-and-wavy-mouth_1f974.png)) Her health plan deductible is super high, though, which means she was hit with major sticker shock when she returned home to her kitties.

Although she set up a payment plan, she struggled to make the $400 monthly installments. Fed up, Cassandra called the hospital billing department. _Boom:_ They connected her with an outside lender for an **interest-free medical loan** that allowed her to pay off her bill with more manageable monthly amounts.

Interest-free medical loans can be a good option for some—but there are a few caveats:

-   **Medical loans shouldn’t be your first option.** Remember [financial aid](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb25leS51c25ld3MuY29tL21vbmV5L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2Uvc3BlbmRpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2hhdC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LWhvc3BpdGFsLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1hc3Npc3RhbmNlLXBvbGljaWVzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6a93e2fa) is available in a vast array of medical scenarios. Even if you’re not eligible, you can ask your care provider for ways to reduce the cost of your treatment. From there, ask for an itemized bill and challenge anything that looks fishy. If the bill is still intimidatingly high, speak with billing to set up a payment plan. Bottom line: Exhaust every option before looking into a loan.
-   **Interest-free doesn’t always mean interest-free.** Though they’re called “interest-free loans,” they’re typically interest-free only during the initial promo period. So if you pay the principal off before that time is up, you’re golden. If not, you could be charged additional retroactive interest. And the only two words scarier than “retroactive interest” are “shellfish poisoning.” (Actually, no. Retroactive interest is still scarier.)
-   **You really, _really_ can’t afford to miss a payment.** Some creditors revoke the interest-free benefit immediately if you miss just one single payment.

Finally, live by the golden rule: **_Just ask._** It took months for Cassandra to question and land a better payment alternative for herself, which is on par with [other frustrated patients](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vaGVhbHRoL2hlYWx0aC1uZXdzL2JpbGxpbmctZXhwZXJ0LWludmVzdGlnYXRlZC1odXNiYW5kcy1lci1iaWxsLXdhcy1hYmxlLWtub2NrLXRob3VzYW5kcy1yY25hNTM2ODM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd90ac3d7) dealing with medical billing in the US.

_What this day in history means for your financial life now._

November 17 is International Students’ Day. ![](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/DeP5xNJK6UVv00kg-heFhiY_m5M_b0shk9kvGC-1hpg1wSulmflWiEw2WSriLxfY9kRfMRyTcD2rAOCrKKV9G6GwFtetVoAkFIaDiOHYx5NVbxstdR-do49wwq3mVXkyjC8Eb1IHuEOhO4oD_3KAYCDzzBROhuw9LcXs=s0-d-e1-ft#https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/graduation-cap_1f393.png) While it may sound like an Instagram challenge to repost your study abroad selfies, the holiday actually spotlights [student activism](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2Jlc3N1Lm9yZy9zaXRlL2Fzc2V0cy9maWxlcy8xMzczL2hpc3Rvcnlfb2ZfdGhlX2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWxfc3R1ZGVudHNfZGF5LnBkZj91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBb1eb4f00). However, the origin story for this holiday is a bit darker.

In November 1939, Nazi police [retaliated against university students](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG93ZWxsbWlsa2VuY2VudGVyLm9yZy9wcm9ncmFtcy9wcm9qZWN0cy92aWV3L2phbi1vcGxldGFsLW1hcnR5ci1vZi1hbi1vY2N1cGllZC1uYXRpb24vaGVybz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBab60ca80) in Prague who had been protesting the Nazi regime. By the end of the raid, nine student union leaders had been killed, and 1,200 other students were sent to concentration camps.

Today, students around the world remember these acts of social responsibility by showcasing the causes they support on International Students’ Day. And while a student’s right to protest may still often be challenged, [even in the US](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNsdS5vcmcvaXNzdWVzL2ZyZWUtc3BlZWNoL3N0dWRlbnQtc3BlZWNoLWFuZC1wcml2YWN5L3N0dWRlbnRzLXJpZ2h0cy1zcGVlY2gtd2Fsa291dHMtYW5kLW90aGVyLXByb3Rlc3RzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB29e11313), groups like the [European Students’ Union](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly9lc3Utb25saW5lLm9yZy9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXN0dWRlbnRzLWRheS1zdHVkZW50YWN0aXZpc20vP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBadfa717e) (ESU) and the [Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2Jlc3N1Lm9yZy9yZXNvdXJjZXMvbmV3cy83OS15ZWFycy1vbi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXN0dWRlbnRzLWRheS0yMDE4Lz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBb937cfbe) (OBESSU) continue to support youth activism.

One cause students tend to care about is their [tuition bill](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWVzbWFnYXppbmUub3JnL2Vjb25vbXkvMjAyMi8xMS8xNC9zdHVkZW50LWxvYW5zLWRlYnQtZm9yZ2l2ZW5lc3M_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBad795686) (shocker). It's become a point of contention between students and administration as students [protest on campus](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZXJrZWxleWJlYWNvbi5jb20vZW1lcnNvbi1zdHVkZW50cy1zZWVrLXRvLW9yZ2FuaXplLWFnYWluc3QtdHVpdGlvbi1yaXNlcy1hbmQtb3RoZXItaW5lcXVhbGl0aWVzLXRoaXMtZmFsbC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBddcbad9a). The federal government has already forgiven [record levels of student debt](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVlbnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9jb3JpbnRoaWFuLWRlYnQtY2FuY2VsLW9wZWQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB2ed54d71) for people who went to high-priced private colleges and universities. But President Biden’s plan to forgive $10,000 to $20,000 of debt per borrower is now [stalled in courts](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29729159.323944/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3R1ZGVudC1sb2FuLWRlYnQtZXhwbGFpbmVyLTFjMmNmMjA3NDU0MTA5ODk0YzYzNzBhYjNlN2FkOTM5P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBa10b2a5f).

So while this holiday is utilized to observe (and possibly participate in) student activism, students don’t limit their social responsibilities to just one day. Maybe the kids will be alright._—Myriam_
