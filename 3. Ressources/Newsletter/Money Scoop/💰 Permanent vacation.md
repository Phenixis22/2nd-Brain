Why just visit a quaint cobblestone town when you could move there, finally afford a home, and learn a new language while you‚Äôre at it?

Some countries offer what‚Äôs known as a¬†[golden visa](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29634838.293298/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29sZGVudmlzYXMuY29tL2NvdW50cnk_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1zJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBcfc5dcea), which grants foreigners perks such as the right to work, access to public education, healthcare, and even pathways to citizenship. But as always, there‚Äôs a catch: You can only qualify by making an investment, such as buying real estate or starting a business‚Äîbasically a golden ticket to the good life (for those who can afford it).¬†üé´

Even though minimum requirements can be steep (Portugal‚Äôs start at¬†[280,000 euros](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29634838.293298/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29sZGVudmlzYXMuY29tL3BvcnR1Z2FsP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB80b9e2ae)¬†or approx. $281,887 to buy a fixer-upper, while Spain requires¬†[500,000 euro](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29634838.293298/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29sZGVudmlzYXMuY29tL3NwYWluP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tcyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe4c6ef34)¬†or approx. $503,370 in real estate investments), that money will give you more bang for your buck than it would in most major US cities. For example, according to¬†[Numbeo](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29634838.293298/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnVtYmVvLmNvbS9jb3N0LW9mLWxpdmluZy9jaXR5X3ByaWNlX3JhbmtpbmdzP2l0ZW1JZD0xMDA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBcee2658b), an apartment in New York City would cost 179% more than an apartment of the same size in Madrid. That‚Äôs almost three apartments for the price of one.

A year after Covid-19 turned everything upside down, Barry Brinker left California and retired on a golden visa in Porto, Portugal, which he said has ‚Äúhit all the buttons‚Äù and has been a great investment. ‚ÄúMy place would cost at least twice as much in the US,‚Äù Brinker told Money Scoop.

# Smart move - Desperately seeking scammer
_Actionable tips to brighten your financial future_

Hello. It‚Äôs me, your friendly and generally savvy financial newsletter writer, who managed to get scammed out of $38 last week.¬†üôÉ

The short version of the story goes like this: Woman posts on Facebook event page seeking concert ticket. Perfectly normal man responds to woman‚Äôs query requesting $38 over Zelle in exchange for ticket. Woman sends payment to normal man. Normal man blocks woman on all channels and scurries away with the cash. Don‚Äôt be like me, folks:¬†**The smart move is to approach ticket resellers with caution.**

I‚Äôve learned a few things from the experience. First, when interacting with strangers, opt for channels like Venmo or PayPal instead of Zelle. Zelle doesn‚Äôt allow credit card payments, which means you‚Äôre 100% liable for any money you send to potential scammers. (Note that not all credit cards will refund you if you get scammed, though. When in doubt, check the fine print.)

Second, if a seller tries to pressure you, it‚Äôs probably too good to be true. At the time, my interaction with the scammer seemed totally normal‚Äîbut in hindsight, his blindingly speedy replies and frenzied follow-ups were all red flags. In the end, I found a ticket elsewhere‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs $38 I could‚Äôve spent on some sweet merch._‚ÄîLillian_

Besides setting up an online storefront, there aren‚Äôt any huge startup costs to dropshipping. That is, until you get to the¬†**influencers who sell dropshipping courses**, which can cost up to¬†[$10,000](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29634838.293298/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZHJvcHNoaXBsaWZlc3R5bGUuY29tL2Vjb21tZXJjZS1jb3Vyc2VzLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bXMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB2968b543).
