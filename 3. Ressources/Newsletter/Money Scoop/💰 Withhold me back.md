# Hello, Money Scoop readers
Midterms are tomorrow in the US. And while whichever political party ends up on top doesn’t dictate how the [stock market performs](https://www.investopedia.com/us-election-and-stock-market-6822056?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew), don’t let that stop you from participating in our sweet, sweet democracy. (If you aren’t sure how or where to vote, check out [Vote.org](https://www.vote.org/?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew).)  🇺🇸

**In today’s edition:**

-   Blaming the clean-up crew
-   Roommates: your bejesus cure
-   Upside down, but in a good way

## 0.75

Another Fed meeting, another [0.75 rate hike](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew). JPow announced the fourth consecutive 75-basis-point hike on the benchmark federal funds rate, which is now approaching 4% (the highest it’s been since 2008). Let’s just hope that JPow isn’t _too_ trigger happy—as major accounting firm KPMG’s [Diane Swonk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-meeting-to-focus-on-interest-rates-coming-path-11667295181?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) put it: “You’re trying to cool down an economy, not throw it into a deep freeze.”

## 6.89%

The investment darling of these uncertain times, I bonds just got humbled. The inflation-hedging security’s returns rate dropped from a record 9.62% rate to [6.89%](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-11-01-2022/card/i-bond-rate-is-now-6-89--2bFlfJCPJf0ZAGvMByJh?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew). But don’t fret if you missed out on those higher returns: Today’s rate, though lower than before, remains one of the highest on record for I bonds, and is still dramatically outpacing the S&P 500’s [YTD performance](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew).

## 43%

According to a [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/midterm-election-survey-2022/?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) survey, 43% of respondents said their finances are worse now than when Biden was elected. But let’s rewind. ⏪ Some would argue that before Biden came to office, we were combating the economic slowdown due to the pandemic with [stimulus checks and tax credits](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/the-pandemic-stimulus-checks-were-a-big-experiment-did-it-work.html?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew)—all expansionary measures that seemed great for our pockets at the time. And now the Fed is swooping in to tackle the inflation aftermath (which is its job). So, does Biden have unlucky timing? Maybe. Is our flailing economy entirely one president’s fault? Not quite.

Have you ever come home from work and found your roommate lying on the couch in the same position as when you left them—with a pile of dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and an odd aroma in the air—and thought “I’m too old for this” to yourself? Well, you might have to take that back.

The number of people over 50 living with roommates is [rising](https://www.nextavenue.org/the-new-golden-girls/?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew), partly due to skyrocketing costs of living, but also because of the companionship and sense of community that comes with sharing a living space.

Joseph Lee is 67 years old and lives with three housemates in a single-family home in Las Vegas. He found them through [PadSplit](https://www.padsplit.com/?utm_campaign=ms&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew), a service that matches prospective renters with available rooms. Lee currently pays $880 per month for rent and utilities—down from $1,200 in his previous apartment, which he left when his landlord upped the rent to $1,800. His new home is in a neighborhood he likes—away from the Strip—and he’s still near his children and grandchildren.

Lee realized he didn’t want to live alone anymore after he had a scare. “A couple of years ago [...] I was waiting for the bus and passed out and broke three ribs,” he said. “It scared the living bejesus out of me,” he continued, adding that he developed a new fear of having a medical emergency and being alone after that day.

Still, Lee didn’t want to burden his sons by moving in with them and decided coliving was the way to go. “I think when you’re older, and you’re looking for companionship, [...] you’re not as picky about the situation.” Hopefully Lee and his roommates share cheesecake and gossip like another set of roommates we know in their golden years. 👵—_Isabel_
