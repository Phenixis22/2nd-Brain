# Good Morning
The World Cup starts tomorrow, and we weren‚Äôt sure it was possible but this already ~unusual~ tournament just got even weirder: In a U-turn from its previous stance, host country Qatar abruptly banned the sale of beer at World Cup stadiums, leaving its $75 million sponsor Budweiser with only alcohol-free Bud Zero to sell inside stadiums.

We‚Äôll get into that mess and lots more in tomorrow‚Äôs special World Cup preview edition of Brew Review. Make sure to check it out.

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to 135 months (that‚Äôs 11.25 years) in¬†[prison](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29747059.3472220/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9saXZlY292ZXJhZ2UvZWxpemFiZXRoLWhvbG1lcy1zZW50ZW5jaW5nLXRoZXJhbm9zLXRyaWFsP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe2025bdf)¬†yesterday for defrauding investors in what would have been the biggest tech scandal news of the week if FTX had never existed.

That‚Äôs less than the 15 years prosecutors sought, but a whole lot more than the 18 months of house arrest her lawyers advocated for. On the white-collar prison time scale ranging from Martha Stewart‚Äôs five months to Bernie Madoff‚Äôs 150 years, Holmes‚Äôs sentence for what the judge estimated to be $121 million worth of scamming is probably starting to make Sam Bankman-Fried a little nervous about that disappearing $32 billion.

**In case you missed the Hulu series, here‚Äôs the backstory:**¬†Once hailed as the next Steve Jobs (all those black turtlenecks helped) and famous for being so intense she never blinked, Holmes turned out to be peddling a fantasy.

-   Holmes dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos‚Äîwhich attracted high-profile investors like Rupert Murdoch and board members like Henry Kissinger‚Äîand grew it into a $10 billion company.
-   The problem? She claimed Theranos had technology that could perform tons of tests on a single drop of blood, but‚Ä¶it couldn‚Äôt (which didn‚Äôt stop her from rolling the tech out to patients). Once the Wall Street Journal exposed the truth and regulators came calling, both the company and Holmes‚Äôs wealth were wiped out.

While sentencing Holmes for deceiving investors, Judge Edward Davila said he wouldn‚Äôt add time for the harm she did to Theranos patients because she was not found guilty of charges related to that. He also said her being the undisputed leader of the company would not count against her. But he said he would consider her failure to take responsibility‚Äîthe government claimed Holmes once said, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt put pretty people like me in jail.‚Äù

**What‚Äôs next:**¬†Holmes could still appeal her conviction.¬†Meanwhile, her ex-romantic and ex-business partner Ramesh ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù Balwani, who was found guilty of 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy, is scheduled to be sentenced in early December._‚ÄîAR_
