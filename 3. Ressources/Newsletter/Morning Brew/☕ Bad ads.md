One company that‚Äôs going to be impacted is Apple: The tech giant‚Äôs share price fell on the news that the unrest will hurt iPhone production. Oil trading also had a volatile day, with futures prices sinking to their lowest for the year over concerns about China, before rebounding some.
# News of the day - China‚Äôs protesters take to the streets‚Äîand the internet
![A Chinese protest](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZpY3cxjQ3ZR6TRY5_QN4ZQ4D99dXCX7C_dKp0YvxYvNlDF-NnYfOO24tamQ1U3UI-DKvES-js-ObDkciELpSM_eiIjdmxm43CuJQdc54bjDTPMaWliOpjv7MrywcCaa_1UzHvKPCU14mM-ODN11-K7JytSXKGZLKKFElVbXc3kPw5VsNLccIvDXYvKIVS0K4rA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/414a6ab08171b8265bbc236fb77c328af0cdf48d-1500x1000.jpg?w=670&q=70&auto=format)_Kevin Frayer/Getty Images_

When negativity and dissent are scrubbed from the internet and criticizing a leader can land you behind bars, protests take on interesting forms. In China, nationwide protests against President Xi Jinping and his government‚Äôs ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù policies are some of the boldest, most defiant, and most¬†[creative](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29828506.3626441/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yOC93b3JsZC9hc2lhL2NoaW5hLXByb3Rlc3RzLWJsYW5rLXNoZWV0cy5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB21885d69)¬†displays of opposition against authority in the country in years.

Demonstrations demanding greater freedom (and not just from restrictive Covid policies) have not only spread to several cities in the country, but also across Chinese social media platforms like WeChat. And protesters are managing to get their message across both IRL and online despite the country‚Äôs notoriously tough censors.

## Evading the mods

Demonstrators are displaying blank white sheets of paper‚Äîa form of protest seen before in Hong Kong and Russia‚Äîsymbolizing what censorship doesn‚Äôt allow dissenters to say. Meanwhile at Xi‚Äôs alma mater, student protesters held up a formula by physicist Alexander Friedmann, alluding to the term ‚Äúfree man.‚Äù

Since China‚Äôs internet is suppressed by firewalls and monitors, messages with double meanings that lack obviously flagged keywords are gaining popularity, as they‚Äôre tougher to find and sanitize. Since the protests began, social media posts sarcastically repeating words like ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù have proliferated.

But, Chinese censors are still not easy to overcome:

-   China‚Äôs state-owned television station appears to be limiting (maskless) crowd shots in World Cup broadcasts to fend off comparisons to other nations‚Äô handling of Covid.
-   On Twitter (where Elon Musk recently fired the anti-propaganda team) search results for major Chinese cities were flooded with pornography, escort services, and gambling content from bots‚Äîmaking it difficult to find news about the protests.

**Are the protests working?**¬†As of yesterday, state media was still praising zero Covid measures, a sign that the government is sticking with the policy for now.‚Äî_MK_

The eruption ended the volcano‚Äôs longest dormant period in recorded history. Though it rained ash nearby, which prompted warnings to residents of the Big Island, the US Geological Survey said yesterday that lava flows were not threatening populated areas.

BlockFi owes its top 10 creditors nearly $1.2 billion, and it‚Äôs too soon to know what will happen to its customers.

As a result, the always understated Musk questioned whether the tech giant hates free speech in America and called out CEO Tim Cook directly. A fight with Apple won‚Äôt help Musk get back his $44 billion investment: Getting booted from its store would limit access to new users, and, according to the Washington Post, Apple was the platform‚Äôs top advertiser in Q1.

The seven largest US rallies were associated with a 21% boost in organ donors compared to the time periods before and after. It‚Äôs not the first study to link rallies to traffic fatalities, and the researchers stressed that safety measures should be increased. Still, amidst a major shortage of organ donors, they also said efforts should be made to ‚Äútranslate eligible deaths from these events into organ donations.‚Äù

**Quote:**¬†‚ÄúIf you want a big hat, let me know.‚Äù

Brian Robinson Jr. led the Washington Commanders to victory Sunday night, but all anyone could talk about yesterday was his post-game¬†[style](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29828506.3626441/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIyLzExLzI3L2JyaWFuLXJvYmluc29uLWNvbW1hbmRlcnMtaGF0Lz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBf5dbbfee). This might be because he opted to wear a comically large baseball cap emblazoned with the team‚Äôs logo. Seems Robinson wanted to get everyone talking to help drive business to a friend‚Äôs big hat company. And it wasn‚Äôt the oversized chapeau‚Äôs first big publicity play: The company behind it, Noggin Boss, also appeared on¬†_Shark Tank_¬†and scored an investment offer from Daymond John.
