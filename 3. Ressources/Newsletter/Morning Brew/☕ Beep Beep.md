# News of the day - Beep beep, your Tesla Semi is finally here

Three years behind schedule, Tesla Semis will finally join their diesel-guzzling pals in boxing you in on the interstate. Last night, the automaker¬†[delivered](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29863952.3632086/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tdXNrLXNldC1maW5hbGx5LXRha2Utd3JhcHMtb2ZmLXRlc2xhLXRydWNrLXRvdWdoLWNyb3dkLTIwMjItMTItMDEvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB47c1ae58)¬†its first electric semitrucks, which are expected to be more powerful and able to travel further than any EV currently whizzing down I-80.

The first company to get the trucks will be Pepsi, which was in the long haul for the long hauls. It ordered 100 trucks when they were first announced in 2017.

## The industry is pumped for the Tesla Semi

Right now, electric trucks are limited by their range: Renault‚Äôs EV semi, for example, can only travel ~125 miles on a single charge. These electric trucks are used only for local and regional trips so they can charge at factories and distribution centers overnight.

But Elon Musk promised that his truck could drive 500 miles on a single charge, a feat that would change the game for adoption of heavy-duty EVs.

However, there are more¬†[speed bumps](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29863952.3632086/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW1lcmdpbmd0ZWNoYnJldy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLzA2LzEwL3doZW4taXQtY29tZXMtdG8tZWxlY3RyaWZ5aW5nLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWhlYXZ5LWR1dHktdmVoaWNsZXMtbGFnLWZhci1iZWhpbmQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldyZtaWQ9MjMwZGY3MDI0N2Q5NjY2ZDAzNDA5ODA5Y2U1MTY0ZGQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB757595df)¬†for EV semis than even an 18-wheeler can clear:

1.  Batteries in these trucks are extremely difficult and expensive to produce‚Äîespecially right now as lithium, the main component of an EV battery, and other crucial minerals are in short supply.
2.  The amount of electricity required to power EV trucks is staggering. Seriously‚Äîthe projected power needed to convert a single gas station into a charging station to support smaller EVs and semis by 2035 would be the amount a small town needs, according to a study from National Grid.

Unlike personal EVs, which have taken off in recent years, EV semitrucks are still on training wheels. If the Tesla Semi succeeds, it could be a big win for 1) the young commercial EV industry and 2) Tesla, which needs a boost after its stock plunged more than 50% this year and its CEO Musk got distracted fighting with Stephen King on Twitter.‚Äî_MM_

The justices agreed to hear the case after the DOJ asked them to lift an injunction from an appeals court that stopped the program from taking effect.

Lady Hussey‚Äôs actions drew a rebuke from her godson, Prince William, who is in Boston with his wife, the Princess of Wales, for their first US visit in eight years. On top of all that, yesterday Netflix dropped the trailer for its documentary about Prince Harry and Meghan, which is sure to portray the monarchy in a negative light.

While lower gas prices are a welcome holiday gift for drivers, they‚Äôre also a pessimistic sign for the economy: Demand for fuel is dropping as the world hunkers down for a potential recession.
