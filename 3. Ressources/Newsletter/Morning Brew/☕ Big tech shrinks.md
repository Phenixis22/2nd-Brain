# Good Morning
Let‚Äôs kick off the newsletter by addressing yesterday‚Äôs global population trivia, which many of you claimed to be a trick question. That was not our aim, but we understand why you may have thought that.

We asked you to guess the population of the Earth in the year 0, because we found a¬†[solid estimate](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29710606.124633/aHR0cHM6Ly9vdXJ3b3JsZGluZGF0YS5vcmcvZ3JhcGhlci9wb3B1bGF0aW9uP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB73257f87)¬†for around that year. But as many of you pointed out, there was no year 0. The Anno Domini nomenclature, used for the Gregorian calendar, skips from 1 BCE to 1 CE, and most other calendars do not have a year 0 either. (Scholars estimate Jesus was born between 6 and 4 BCE, not 0, because‚Ä¶there is no 0.)

Of the many tech stocks that gained yesterday was Taiwan Semiconductor, which surged after Warren Buffett revealed he took a stake.
# News of the day - Big Tech pulls back on futuristic bets
The days of an internet company trying to e-scooter their way to solving world hunger through solar-powered NFT horse racing just to compete with Disney+ are over. Futuristic projects that were once a staple of Big Tech line items are getting squeezed in this ‚Äúwe definitely¬†can‚Äôt afford that anymore‚Äù economy.

That was made very clear yesterday.

1. As part of its anticipated mass layoffs this week, Amazon began to¬†[cut employees](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29710606.124633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNS9hbWF6b24tc3RhcnRzLWN1dHRpbmctam9icy1pbi1hbGV4YS11bml0LWFuZC1jbG91ZC1nYW1pbmctZGl2aXNpb24uaHRtbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB306e18f5)¬†who were working on its AI assistant, Alexa. That division has an operating loss of more than $5 billion per year.

2. The hedge fund TCI Fund Management, which has a $6 billion stake in Alphabet,¬†[urged](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29710606.124633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hY3RpdmlzdC1pbnZlc3Rvci1jYWxscy1vbi1nb29nbGUtcGFyZW50LWFscGhhYmV0LXRvLXNsYXNoLWNvc3RzLTExNjY4NTI4ODU5P21vZD1ocF9sZWFkX3BvczQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB1f9106ec)¬†Google‚Äôs parent company to join its Big Tech peers in laying off workers yesterday, saying it‚Äôs overstaffed and paying its employees too much. It took specific aim at Google‚Äôs famous Other Bets division that incubated ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù projects like Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company.¬†That Other Bets unit brought in $3 billion in revenue over the last five years, but incurred $20 billion in operating losses, TCI‚Äôs letter to CEO Sundar Pichai said.

**Big picture:**¬†While Snap and Microsoft are also nixing riskier long-term bets, the big Big Tech exception is Meta. Zuck has cut back on some experimentation, but is staying committed to spending billions on the metaverse, despite investor concerns._‚ÄîAR_

¬†**üöÄ¬†We‚Äôre going to the mooooon.**¬†Or, at the very least, we took a big step in that direction.

There aren‚Äôt any humans on board, but if this and subsequent test missions go well, the same rocket‚Äìcapsule combo will be used to return people to the lunar surface as soon as 2025. The current mission, which is taking the Orion capsule around the moon and back, is expected to last 26 days.

üáµüá±¬†**A mysterious missile struck Poland.**¬†Amid a barrage of Russian attacks on Ukraine, one missile¬†[struck Poland](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29710606.124633/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUtd2FyLXplbGVuc2t5eS1raGVyc29uLTkyMDJjMDMyY2YzYTVjMjI3NjFlZTcxYjUyZmY5ZDUyP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9aG9tZXBhZ2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1Ub3BOZXdzJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1wb3NpdGlvbl8wMQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB7eab967c)¬†and killed two people. The explosion is raising alarms because Poland is a member of NATO, and an attack on one NATO country would compel all the others to join the fight. But it‚Äôs not clear whether this missile actually came from Russia. Poland said it was a Russian-made missile, while President Biden, who convened an emergency meeting of world powers following the missile strike, said it was ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù that Russia fired it.

The 98-year-old investor has been criticizing cryptocurrencies for years (calling bitcoin a ‚Äúdelusion‚Äù and ‚Äúprobably rat poison squared‚Äù), and he appears to have been vindicated by FTX‚Äôs collapse. ‚ÄúPeople think this is a real asset.
