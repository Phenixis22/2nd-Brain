# Good Morning
Today is the day when having a second monitor comes up really clutch, because at 2pm ET, the US Men‚Äôs National Team will kick off their World Cup campaign against Wales.

The US men‚Äôs team didn‚Äôt qualify for the previous World Cup, so this will be their first tournament match in eight years. But if that sounds like a long time to wait, think about how much this means to Welsh people: Their team hadn‚Äôt qualified for the World Cup in 64 years.

Bob Chapek must be feeling as tossed aside as Woody in the first¬†_Toy Story_. In a Sunday night news dump for the ages, Disney announced that former CEO Bob Iger would¬†[return](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29757703.4116694/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yMS9ib2ItaWdlci1uYW1lZC1kaXNuZXktY2VvLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1pbW1lZGlhdGVseS5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB56eb896b)¬†to his role atop the entertainment giant, replacing his successor Chapek, who‚Äôs been CEO for less than three years.

**This was‚Ä¶surprising.**¬†After leading the company for 15 years, Iger handed over the reins to Chapek in February 2020. It was an unexpected choice, given that streaming boss Kevin Mayer was seen as a more likely heir to the Disney throne than Chapek, who led the parks and entertainment division. But Iger had reportedly handpicked Chapek as his successor, and repeatedly said he was satisfied with being retired. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a better person to succeed me in this role,‚Äù Iger said in March 2020.

## But Chapek never really hit his stride

First, the Covid-19 pandemic upended the company‚Äôs business, forcing parks to close and movie theaters to shut down.

Then, Chapek¬†[struggled to contain](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29757703.4116694/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS9kaXNuZXktYm9iLWlnZXItcmV0dXJucy1jZW8tYm9iLWNoYXBlay1vdXQtMTIzNTE3ODIyMy8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBbb0b8a17)¬†multiple controversies.

-   Initially, he did not come out forcefully against Florida‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù law, which ticked off many employees.
-   During his watch, Disney also got into a high-profile dust-up with actor Scarlett Johansson over her compensation for¬†_Black Widow_.

The company‚Äôs recent performance appears to have been the final straw that sent the board crawling back to Iger. Both Disney‚Äôs streaming unit and the parks division underperformed expectations last quarter. This year, shares are down 41%.

## Can Iger turn things around?

He has quite the track record. During his OG tenure as CEO, Disney reinvented itself by acquiring Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. Disney‚Äôs board hopes Iger will similarly right the ship during the two years he‚Äôs slated to stay on.

‚ÄúAs Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the Company through this pivotal period,‚Äù board Chairman Susan Arnold wrote.

**Big picture:**¬†Bringing on a former CEO to provide stability is not unprecedented in corporate America. The formerly spurned Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, and former Starbucks boss Howard Schultz recently returned to the company as interim CEO.
