# Good Morning
Yesterday started with a lunar eclipse and ended with a big question mark. Control of both chambers of Congress is still unknown, as key races remain too close to call and many votes remain to be counted. We‚Äôll go over what we¬†_do_¬†know below.

If there‚Äôs anything you can bet on in politics, it‚Äôs that the party¬†_not_¬†in the White House makes big Congressional gains in the midterm elections.

But that does not appear to be the case this time around.

In elections dominated by economic concerns, Democrats performed¬†[much better than expected](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29635756.4150796/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi1taWR0ZXJtLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1yZXN1bHRzLTk1NGRlMzIwMGE1NDY3ZDM2ZWE1ZjA0ZTRjY2JiNzhmP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9aG9tZXBhZ2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1Ub3BOZXdzJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1wb3NpdGlvbl8wMQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB4ba27140), perhaps dodging a so-called ‚Äúred wave‚Äù that threatened to kick them out of power in both chambers.

The fates of both the Senate and the House are still unclear as the sun rises on Wednesday‚Äîand we may not know the outcome for days or weeks with major races still yet to be called. The infamous NYT ‚Äú[needle](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29635756.4150796/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMi8xMS8wOC91cy9lbGVjdGlvbnMvcmVzdWx0cy1uZWVkbGUtZm9yZWNhc3QuaHRtbD9hY3Rpb249Y2xpY2smcGd0eXBlPUFydGljbGUmc3RhdGU9ZGVmYXVsdCZtb2R1bGU9ZWxlY3Rpb24tcmVzdWx0cyZjb250ZXh0PWVsZWN0aW9uX3JlY2lyYyZyZWdpb249Rm9yZWNhc3RXcmFwcGVy/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6e18d6e1)‚Äù shows that the Senate is ‚Äúleaning‚Äù the Dems‚Äô way while Republicans are ‚Äúprobably‚Äù going to retake the House.

Here‚Äôs a recap of the biggest headlines.

**Fetterman defeats Oz.**¬†In a closely watched race in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Democrats flipped a seat when John Fetterman defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor who was backed by former President Trump.

**The pivotal contests that haven‚Äôt been called yet:**¬†Dozens of House races, including in New York and California, are too close to call. In the Senate, undecided races in Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada will determine control of the chamber. Republicans need to win three of those to gain control.

**Republicans sweep Florida.**¬†In a state that‚Äôs moved dramatically to the right, Republicans will control every statewide office for the first time since the Reconstruction era. Both Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis romped¬†in their reelection campaigns.

**Gubernatorial candidates make history.**¬†Democrat Maura Healey of Massachusetts was elected the first openly lesbian governor in the US and the state‚Äôs first woman governor. GOP Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman to serve as Arkansas‚Äôs governor, the office occupied by her father, Mike Huckabee, for 10 years. And Democrat Wes Moore will become Maryland‚Äôs first Black governor.

**States protect abortion rights.**¬†In ballot measures sparked by the Supreme Court‚Äôs overturning of Roe v. Wade, California, Michigan, and Vermont voted to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions. An abortion rights vote in Kentucky is still too close to call.

**Gen Z comes to Congress.**¬†Guess they don‚Äôt just scroll through TikTok all day. 25-year-old Democrat Maxwell Frost¬†[won](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29635756.4150796/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy8yMDIyLzExLzA4LzExMzQ3NDM5MDgvbWF4d2VsbC1mcm9zdC1jYWx2aW4td2ltYmlzaC1mbG9yaWRhLTEwdGgtaG91c2UtbWlkdGVybXMtcmVzdWx0cz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB32b0ebf7)¬†the race for Florida‚Äôs 10th Congressional District, becoming the first member of Gen Z to be elected to Congress.‚Äî_NF_

The location where the winning ticket was purchased: Joe‚Äôs Service Center in Altadena, California. The lump sum payout: $997 million. And if you didn‚Äôt think things could get any better for the jackpot victor, the fact that they bought the ticket in CA means they won‚Äôt face state taxes on lottery winnings.

¬†**üìâ¬†Zuck takes blame for Meta‚Äôs layoffs.**¬†Ahead of Meta‚Äôs job cuts, which are expected to be announced this morning, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told lieutenants that he personally was¬†[overly optimistic](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29635756.4150796/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tZXRhcy1tYXJrLXp1Y2tlcmJlcmctc2F5cy1oZS1pcy1hY2NvdW50YWJsZS1hcy1jb21wYW55LXByZXBzLWZvci1tYXNzLWxheW9mZnMtMTE2Njc5NDExMDc_bW9kPWhwX2xlYWRfcG9zMg/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB4e225238)¬†about growth and hired too many employees, per the WSJ. Meta‚Äôs job cuts are likely to be the worst of all the tech layoffs so far this year, and will be the first widespread job cuts the company‚Äôs ever had to make.

¬†**üá∫üá¶¬†Volodymyr Zelensky is open to peace talks.**¬†Ukraine‚Äôs president signaled he would consider¬†[negotiating with Russia](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29635756.4150796/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUtemVsZW5za3l5LXB1dGluLWt5aXYtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtcG9saXRpY3MtNDdlMzFiMmUyYzE2YjkyOTU1MzQyYjY3MzI1NmQ4ZDc_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1ob21lcGFnZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPVRvcE5ld3MmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvc2l0aW9uXzA1/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB625769b9), something he had been vehemently against just a few months ago. However, any truce with Russia would be conditional on a) the return of occupied Ukrainian territory b) the prosecution of Russian war crimes and c) compensation for damages caused by the war. Behind the scenes, the US has been nudging Zelensky to publicly say he‚Äôd be willing to talk to Russia.

**Stat:**¬†Is La Condesa the new Williamsburg?

(Mexican officials also say the # of American expats is almost certainly an undercount.) For remote workers, the lure of Mexico City in particular is obvious: Your dollar will go far, the climate is exquisite, the cafe culture is on point, and the culinary mecca has four of the best 50 bars in the world.
