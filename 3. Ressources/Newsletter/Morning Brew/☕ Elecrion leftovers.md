# Good Morning
The official starting pistol of the holiday season just went off: Linsday Lohan‚Äôs Christmas movie,¬†_Falling for Christmas_, arrives on Netflix today. It‚Äôs Lohan‚Äôs first starring role in a film since 2013.

And if it doesn‚Äôt end in a dramatic race through an airport on Christmas Eve to tell a guy that she met a week ago she loves him, we will riot.

Binance‚Äôs affair with FTX was just a one-night stand. After agreeing to take over FTX on Tuesday, Binance said it was¬†[walking away](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29650551.3683876/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wOS9iaW5hbmNlLWJhY2tzLW91dC1vZi1mdHgtcmVzY3VlLWxlYXZpbmctdGhlLWNyeXB0by1leGNoYW5nZS1vbi10aGUtYnJpbmstb2YtY29sbGFwc2UuaHRtbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBafebdfbb)¬†from the deal yesterday, leaving its collapsed rival exchange on the brink of extinction.

Facing a shortfall of up to $8 billion, FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried (aka ‚ÄúSBF‚Äù) reportedly told investors that his firm needed a cash injection or it would go bankrupt.

**Quick recap:**¬†On Tuesday, SBF tweeted the stunning news that his company was going to be bailed out by rival Binance after FTX suffered mass withdrawals. Why was this so shocking? FTX is a giant in the space and was considered a source of stability amid the chaos of crypto winter. Recently valued at $32 billion, it was reportedly going to be bought for $1.

But even $1 proved too pricey for Binance once it found the 12-foot skeletons in FTX‚Äôs closet. The company took a look at FTX‚Äôs books yesterday and saw a ‚Äú[financial black hole](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29650551.3683876/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMTEtMDkvYmluYW5jZS1zZWVuLWxpa2VseS10by1iYWxrLWF0LWZ0eC1kZWFsLWFmdGVyLXNwb3R0aW5nLWRlZXAtaG9sZT9zcmVmPUtrUHpwWnZ6/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB048fad42),‚Äù Bloomberg wrote.

Plus, US regulators smelled blood and have started to investigate whether FTX mishandled customer funds. Binance had no interest in taking on that baggage.

## This episode is a disaster for crypto

FTX‚Äôs meltdown could single-handedly wipe out whatever legitimacy the crypto industry had left. Don‚Äôt take it from us‚Äîhere‚Äôs what crypto execs themselves said about it.

-   Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao said the FTX calamity was not ‚Äúa win‚Äù and had ‚Äúseverely shaken‚Äù confidence in crypto.
-   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a not a good thing for anybody,‚Äù Coinbase‚Äôs CEO Brian Armstrong said.

**Why?**¬†It has to do with regulation. SBF frequently visited Washington, DC, to work with lawmakers on regulating the Wild West of crypto. But with crypto‚Äôs most trustworthy diplomat left holding the bag after an epic collapse, regulators who feel duped could try to buckle the industry.

The most humiliation in this entire episode is, of course, reserved for SBF himself. When he was at the top of the crypto world, the 30-year-old billionaire discussed his grand ambition of giving away his fortune to help humanity.

Now, there‚Äôs little fortune left. On Tuesday, SBF‚Äôs net worth plunged from $15.6 billion to less than $1 billion. That 94% evisceration is the worst one-day wipeout for a billionaire ever tracked by Bloomberg.
