# Good Morning
Hope your Thanksgiving weekend was relaxing and your turkey came out moist. Some things I learned over the past few days:

-   12:30pm isn‚Äôt nearly early enough to arrive at a sports bar for a US soccer game that starts at 2.
-   The Holiday Train Show at the New York Botanical Garden followed by an eggplant parm on Arthur Avenue makes for an excellent day.
-   Do not ever, for any reason, try to leave Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel.

But, it is great to be back with you all. Hopefully I‚Äôm not too rusty‚Ä¶

# News of the day - Chinese protesters call on Xi Jinping to resign

In China, you can be put in prison if you‚Äôre heard criticizing President Xi Jinping.

But after suffering through nearly three years of ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù policies that have upended people‚Äôs lives and confined them to their houses for months, some are starting to risk it. During a¬†[series of protests](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29818006.3626724/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGFpd2FuLWhlYWx0aC1maXJlcy1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtNTBkNzUxNWU1ZmFlMDBmNTA1NDA2MjIwOWU5MzA2Y2M_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1ob21lcGFnZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPVRvcE5ld3MmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvc2l0aW9uXzAz/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBb111720d)¬†in Shanghai, Beijing, and other cities against Covid restrictions this weekend, Chinese demonstrators were reportedly chanting ‚ÄúXi Jinping, step down‚Äù and ‚ÄúCommunist party, step down.‚Äù They also held up sheets of blank white paper to symbolize the Chinese government‚Äôs censorship of content it doesn‚Äôt want spreading around the internet.

China analysts say this kind of public defiance is unprecedented for Xi Jinping‚Äôs presidency, and could spiral into the worst political crisis for Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

## What sparked the Covid protests?

They were instigated by a¬†[fire](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29818006.3626724/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMTEtMjcvY2hpbmEtY292aWQtdW5yZXN0LWJvaWxzLW92ZXItYXMtY2l0aXplbnMtZGVmeS1sb2NrZG93bi1lZmZvcnRzP3NyZWY9S2tQenBadno/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB96634022)¬†that killed 10 people in an apartment block in the city of Urumqi. Many people have claimed that Covid lockdown measures hampered rescue efforts, contributing to the tragedy (officials have denied this).

Also fueling some frustration is the contrast between the bleak situation in China and the festive World Cup in Qatar. Seeing jubilant, maskless crowds and a ~normal~ global event take place has led some Chinese people to question if they are living on a¬†[different planet](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29818006.3626724/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWFzaWEtY2hpbmEtNjM3MzU5MjM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBb28074e5)¬†than the rest of the world, as one person put it on social media.

Meanwhile, China‚Äôs Covid policies and the increasingly bold public reaction to them are threatening companies halfway across the world. Employees who work at the world‚Äôs biggest iPhone plant violently tussled with security staff last week after officials clamped down on an outbreak at the facility. The clashes could lead to¬†[major shortages](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29818006.3626724/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTQtbWFqb3Itc2hvcnRhZ2VzLXplcm8tY292aWQvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBdbf8a3fb)¬†of the new iPhone 14, analysts say‚Äîjust when everyone is trying to snag one for the holidays.

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶** all eyes are on the Chinese government‚Äôs next moves to quell the dissent that appears to only be intensifying. Oh, and this seems important: Covid cases in China hit a record for a fourth straight day on Saturday

The unit that houses the AI assistant posted an operating loss of more than $3 billion in the first quarter, according to internal docs seen by Insider. And the company is on pace to lose ~$10 billion this year on Alexa and its devices, which have been difficult to monetize. Given lack of direction and recent layoffs in the devices unit, employees say Alexa is in crisis mode, per Insider.
