# Good Morning
Recession = averted. The Houston Astros beat the Philadelphia Phillies to win the World Series Saturday night, pushing the most reliable recession indicator we have (a Philly-based team won in ’29, ’30, ’80, and ’08) off for at least a year.

For us Philly fans, it’s a tough loss after a magical playoff run, but let’s look on the bright side: The Eagles are 8–0. And we also have [Alexander Tominsky](https://defector.com/the-sports-highlight-of-the-day-is-phillys-chicken-man-eating-a-chicken/?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew), a server at a Philly steakhouse who went viral this weekend after he ate a rotisserie chicken for the 40th consecutive day.

-   **Markets:** Last week was a [rough one](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) in the stock market, and this week could be even more unpredictable. The midterms on Tuesday, an inflation report Thursday, and another batch of earnings will give investors plenty of new information to absorb. We have to give Berkshire Hathaway a shoutout, because Warren Buffett works overtime and reported his company’s earnings over the weekend. Berkshire’s $109 billion cash pile has ballooned thanks to rising interest rates.
# News of the day - This sign could determine the election
[![A gas station](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/aca58da3508bdebd1d23fa180b7b43ce45952eff-8256x5504.jpg?w=670&q=70&auto=format)](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/11/06/why-gas-prices-are-so-important-to-elections?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew&mid={{md5(profile.email)}})_Brandon Bell/Getty Images_

The outcome of tomorrow’s midterm elections could be influenced by something the government has little control over: the cost of filling up your car with gas.

Since the 1970s, presidential approval ratings have tended to sag when gas prices rise. And that correlation has been especially pronounced this year as inflation has run rampant and gas prices have spiked.

-   The Washington Post found that the share of Americans who said the country was on the right track has moved [remarkably in sync](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/gas-prices-election-biden/?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) with gas prices.
-   Since gas prices peaked in June, the correlation between Democratic generic-ballot polling and the price of gas clocked in at minus-.91, nearly a perfect inverse correlation (which is minus-1).

## Why are gas prices so powerful?

Because it’s the only consumer good whose price [we’re reminded of](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/upshot/gas-prices-biden-midterms.html?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) virtually every time we leave the house, experts say. Unlike tuna fish or patio furniture or sneakers, the price of gas is advertised in size-500 font on huge signs that you can’t help but notice.

Gas prices have been so beaten into us that they can change our behavior over decades. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania discovered that people who experienced raging gas prices in their formative driving years in the 1970s seemed [less likely to drive](https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/news-insights/the-formative-effects-of-gas-price-shocks/?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) to work 20 years later than other age cohorts.

The curious part about the link between voter sentiment and gas prices is that gas prices have very little to do with whoever’s occupying the White House. Gas prices are largely influenced by the price of crude oil, which is a globally traded commodity. That commodity has been dealt a shock this year by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, technical snags with refineries in the US, and OPEC+’s production cuts.

Still, President Biden’s team is [fully aware](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/11/02/biden-klain-gas-prices/?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) of the importance of gas prices, which explains his incessant attacks on oil companies’ windfall profits, his releasing of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and his visit to Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer.

**Price check:** The current national average for a gallon of unleaded gas is $3.80, per AAA. That’s roughly the same as a month ago, down significantly from the record of more than $5, but about 38 cents more than a year ago.

🎰 **The Powerball jackpot surges to $1.9 billion.** There was [no lucky winner](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/06/powerball-numbers-lottery-drawing-billion-jackpot?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) in Saturday night’s drawing for the record-breaking Powerball jackpot, so the prize has swelled ahead of tonight’s drawing. If no one wins tonight, it will set the record for the most consecutive Powerball drawings without a grand prize winner (41). If you win and choose the cash option, you’ll get $929.1 million. Unfortunately, you’re not going to win.

👋 **Elon Musk pulls a Jackson 5.** He wants you back. Just days after cutting half of its workforce, Twitter has been asking some employees who were laid off to [come back to work](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-06/twitter-now-asks-some-fired-workers-to-please-come-back?srnd=premium&sref=KkPzpZvz), according to Bloomberg. Some were reportedly laid off mistakenly, while leaders realized that other employees who were cut are needed to create some new features Musk wants to launch. Speaking of those new features, Twitter has reportedly delayed the rollout of its $8 per month verification program until after the midterms.

💔 **RIP Aaron Carter.** The singer and actor [died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/arts/music/aaron-carter-dead.html?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew) at 34. Carter was a teen sensation in the early 2000s, singing about how he beat Shaq in a game of HORSE and releasing the hit “I Want Candy.” His 2000 album, _Aaron’s Party_, sold 3 million copies. Carter had spoken publicly about his mental health challenges, but in a recent podcast episode expressed hope that he could revive his career and fix his tumultuous family life.
