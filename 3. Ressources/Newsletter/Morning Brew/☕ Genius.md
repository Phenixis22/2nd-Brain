# Good Morning
Little did we know how critical that extra hour of sleep last Sunday was, because this week‚Äôs news needs its own Wikipedia page.

Just off the top of our heads‚Ä¶FTX imploded, Elon Musk seems to be lighting $44 billion on fire with Twitter, the midterm elections delivered a Democratic surprise, inflation might be finally cooling off, stocks had their best day in years, someone won a record $2.04 billion lottery jackpot‚Ä¶and we didn‚Äôt even mention that Taylor Swift expanded her Eras Tour to 52 dates.

If you need anything, we‚Äôll be at Olive Garden. Only unlimited breadsticks can revive us.

Still, the S&P 500 had its best week since June and the Nasdaq‚Äôs gains showed tech stocks are looking hot again. But even as the broader market rose, shares in the top three producers of insulin all dipped yesterday after a Twitter account verified through the briefly expanded Twitter Blue program posed as Eli Lilly on Thursday and said the company was making the drug free.

Warren Buffett famously noted, ‚ÄúOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who‚Äôs been swimming naked,‚Äù and this week it looks like many tech entrepreneurs who had us all convinced they were geniuses might really have been splashing around shortsless.

To recap:

-   **FTX,**¬†the world‚Äôs second-biggest crypto exchange, filed for¬†[bankruptcy](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29677111.3644047/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZnR4LWNyeXB0by1iYW5rcnVwdGN5LWZpbGluZy1lZDBmMDZjNWRiNDY4ZTI4NWY1OGFmMmQ4NzY2YjUxYT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd0414893)¬†yesterday days after a plan to sell itself to rival Binance for $1 dollar (a far cry from its recent $32 billion valuation) fell apart. The exchange‚Äôs meltdown took the net worth of founder Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äîaka SBF, who positioned himself as the public face of crypto‚Äîfrom $16 billion to $0. He resigned as CEO but is still being investigated for possible crimes or securities law violations, per AP.
-   **Meta**¬†laid off 11,000 staffers on Wednesday, with the company dragged down in large part by CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs commitment to building a metaverse that possibly no one else wants.
-   **Elon Musk‚Äôs**¬†second week in charge of Twitter was pure chaos, including the frenzied launch of his pet pay-for-blue-check plan, which had to be paused after accounts impersonating big brands revealed its flaws. He even said the company could go bankrupt. This hasn‚Äôt inspired confidence in how he‚Äôs leading his other major ventures: Tesla stock, which was already having a rough year, fell ~6% this week.
-   **Masayoshi Son,**¬†SoftBank‚Äôs founder and chief unicorn hunter, said yesterday he‚Äôd step back from the day to day after the firm‚Äôs signature Vision Fund reported a $10 billion quarterly loss.

Of course, Zuck and Musk could both still turn things around, but this week‚Äôs giant missteps¬†suggest that¬†_maybe_¬†the stories we tell ourselves about the biggest personalities in Big Tech aren‚Äôt all true‚Äîand maybe a decade of low interest rates helped them out more than they admitted. Or, as Mike Novogratz, a crypto investor who expects to lose $77 million in the FTX debacle, put it: ‚ÄúThis is a tale as old as time. Some young charismatic guy in Bermuda shorts with the floppy hair charmed the 20 best investors and regulators in the world.‚Äù‚Äî_AR_

**üó≥Ô∏è¬†**The Democrats are one win away from holding the Senate.**¬†Incumbent Sen.

That means Kelly‚Äôs party needs to score just one more seat in the chamber for control (with the vice president‚Äôs tie-breaking vote), and two remain up for grabs. Ballots are still being counted in Nevada, and in Georgia a runoff vote is already scheduled for December. When it comes to the House, neither party has had a decisive victory yet, but the GOP is nearly there.

The emergency, first issued in January 2020, broadens eligibility for both Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, and the government estimates that ~15 million people will lose their benefits from those programs once it ends.
