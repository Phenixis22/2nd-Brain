# Good Morning
This intro is dedicated to anyone who‚Äôs lost friends by playing the word ‚Äúqat‚Äù in Scrabble.

The seventh edition of the official Scrabble dictionary has been released with about 500 new words. Some of our favorites from the new batch:

-   ‚ÄúGuac‚Äù (shorthand for guacamole) now counts.
-   ‚ÄúFauxhawk,‚Äù which could reliably get you lots of points, is also kosher.
-   ‚ÄúZonkey‚Äù and ‚Äúzedonk‚Äù are both new entries for the starting letter Z. What‚Äôs the difference? A zonkey is the offspring of a male zebra and a female donkey, while a zedonk is the offspring of a male donkey and a female zebra.

The Taylor Swift Eras Tour presale started Tuesday and it‚Äôs running about as smoothly as a garbage disposal full of baby teeth. Fans have recounted horror stories of Ticketmaster glitches,¬†[hourslong virtual queues](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29722430.3663661/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZWZlY3Rvci5jb20vaXQtc2hvdWxkbnQtYmUtdGhpcy1oYXJkLXRvLWJ1eS1jb25jZXJ0LXRpY2tldHMvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9c3Vic3RhY2smdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB3a987c37), and tickets on resale sites hitting five digits, renewing accusations that Ticketmaster is a monopoly that harms consumers.

**What happened:**¬†A select few Swifties got a special code that was supposed to let them snag tickets priced anywhere from $49‚Äì$450 apiece before the masses could. But Ticketmaster was not prepared for the millions of fans it said showed up to secure a ticket to Swift‚Äôs first tour since 2018, despite issuing the presale codes.

Downdetector.com showed 5,000+ outages for the site on Tuesday around noon, according to Axios. Ticketmaster issued an apology and pushed back other scheduled Taylor presales.

-   Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said he worried Ticketmaster may have potentially violated consumer protection laws.
