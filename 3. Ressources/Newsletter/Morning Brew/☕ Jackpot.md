# Good Morning
Did you know that you‚Äôre able to get free swag when you share the Brew? You certainly can‚Äîand we‚Äôre here with a little update on those rewards.

-   After getting just one (1) referral, we‚Äôll send you a tote bag for you to rock this winter‚Äîthe perfect complement to a cute hat and mittens.
-   At seven referrals, we‚Äôll send you a ~mystery~ item of swag. It‚Äôs like opening up a holiday gift, but knowing it‚Äôs going to rock.

To put a point on it: If you send out your referral link to your group chat (an excellent tactic) and one person signs up to the Brew, you‚Äôll get an MB tote, on us.

Get started by¬†[clicking here](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29562510.3504409/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3JlZmVyLWEtZnJpZW5kP2FjY2Vzc190b2tlbj10YVpodTh0OUt5R0duVnlHd2h6NW1qZzMmbWlkPTIzMGRmNzAyNDdkOTY2NmQwMzQwOTgwOWNlNTE2NGRk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd1350316)¬†to grab your referral link or by scrolling to the referral hub at the bottom of the email.

Why? Because in this economy, good news = bad news. The good news is that job openings in September cruised higher, signaling a healthy labor market. The bad news: A resilient labor market could force the Fed to extend its rate hikes longer than expected.
-   **Economy:**¬†Speaking of the Fed, it‚Äôll announce its next rate hike today. All signs point to its fourth-straight increase of 75 basis points.

On trial for corruption charges, Netanyahu has mounted a political comeback by forming an alliance with right wing and religious parties. If Netanyahu‚Äôs bloc keeps its lead (a big if, since they‚Äôre still tallying votes), he‚Äôd attempt to create the most right-wing and religious coalition in Israel‚Äôs history. The final results will be reported on Friday.
