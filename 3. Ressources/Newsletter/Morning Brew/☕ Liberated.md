Democrats pinned the tail on the donkey this weekend, securing the¬†[50th Senate seat](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29687317.3643926/aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9Qb2xpdGljcy9kZW1vY3JhdHMtY29udHJvbC1zZW5hdGUtYWJjLW5ld3MtcHJvamVjdHMvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTI2ODE2MDM/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe164298e)¬†required for control of the chamber for the final two years of President Biden‚Äôs term. The clincher came in Nevada, where incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt in a tight race.

And while midterm elections are typically a big letdown for the ruling party, Democrats could even¬†_pick up_¬†a Senate seat this surprising election cycle. Georgia‚Äôs race between incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker is headed to a runoff in December‚Äîif Warnock wins, Democrats will have 51 Senate seats, giving them some extra breathing room.

**Over in the House,**¬†which has yet to be decided, the path to victory looks much easier for Republicans than it does Democrats right now. Of the 19 current undecided races, the GOP needs to win just six.

## So what does a Democratic Senate/GOP House mean?

**For legislation‚Ä¶**it means Dems will have their hands tied. Due to pushback from a GOP-led House, they will likely not be able to enact major new progressive programs like they did in the past two years (such as the Inflation Reduction Act). But the threat of their wins being reversed by Republicans is significantly diminished.

**For the judiciary‚Ä¶** having control of the Senate, where judges and executive nominees are confirmed, is¬†[crucial for Democrats](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29687317.3643926/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9wb2xpY3ktYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIzNDI1MDUxL21pZHRlcm0tZWxlY3Rpb25zLTIwMjItc2VuYXRlLW1ham9yaXR5LWNvbmdyZXNzLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1jb3J0ZXotbWFzdG8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB08fe2bed), who will get to work filling the 118 open federal judicial vacancies with their judges. Plus, were a Supreme Court justice position to open up, they‚Äôd be in the driver‚Äôs seat to confirm their preferred nominee.

**For issues of immediate concern‚Ä¶** it means Dems and Republicans will have to work together to solve pressing issues facing the government. The two that are top-of-mind are a) literally funding the government to prevent a shutdown and b) raising the debt ceiling so the Treasury doesn‚Äôt default.

**While we‚Äôre here...** some fun midterms stats:

If his story rings a bell, it‚Äôs because Nasseri‚Äôs saga inspired the 2004 film¬†_The Terminal_, which starred Tom Hanks. For his first 11 years living in the airport, Nasseri wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave due lack of proper documentation‚Äîbut even once he was granted entry to France in 1999, he stayed in the terminal for another seven years. Nasseri returned to the airport a few weeks prior to his death.
