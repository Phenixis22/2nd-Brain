# Good Morning
Best of luck to everyone running the New York City Marathon tomorrow. It‚Äôs the biggest marathon in the world, with a field of 50,000+ runners and a route that spans five bridges and all five boroughs.

Once you get to north Williamsburg, scan the roof for the people in the Brew sweatshirts‚Äîwe‚Äôll be cheering you on.

-   **Markets:**¬†Stocks closed their otherwise terrible week on a high note following another solid jobs report for October.

Just over one week since Elon Musk closed his $44 billion¬†[acquisition](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29600697.3675615/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1zNWFWWnQ5MHhyTQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB5adf6978)¬†of Twitter, he laid off roughly half of the company‚Äôs workforce, about 3,700 people, yesterday.

**It was chaos.**¬†Thursday night, Twitter sent out a company-wide email that told employees they would be informed of their job status via email. Ahead of the cuts, Twitter temporarily closed its offices and blocked workers from accessing internal tools.

But was this process legal? A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Twitter for not giving employees sufficient notice about layoffs and violating worker protection laws. However, the lawyer who brought the suit said Musk ‚Äúis making an effort to comply.‚Äù

**All the turbulence is scaring advertisers.**¬†General Mills, Pfizer, and Volkswagen are just a few of the major brands that have paused ads on Twitter in recent days. Musk¬†[acknowledged](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29600697.3675615/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTU4ODUzODY0MDQwMTAxODg4MD9zPTIwJnQ9QjViNHVGbkFPU2I4WHo3dUJxa2NJdw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBf1639b06)¬†the advertiser exodus yesterday, tweeting that the platform has seen a huge drop in revenue due to ‚Äúactivist groups pressuring advertisers.‚Äù

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**with advertisers jumping ship, Musk is in a race against time to¬†[secure new revenue sources](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29600697.3675615/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1zNWFWWnQ5MHhyTQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efC5adf6978). To make up the gap, Twitter is expected to launch its excessively roasted $8/month subscription plan on Monday.

**Final note:**¬†As Musk tries to trim costs via mass layoffs, Quartz‚Äôs Scott Nover¬†[reminds us](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29600697.3675615/aHR0cHM6Ly9xei5jb20vZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItd2VlZC1qb2tlLTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLTE4NDk3NDI5OTQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB19960ace)¬†that the Chief Twit paid at least an extra $153 million for Twitter by pushing up his bid to $54.20 per share as a weed joke.‚Äî_MM_

While last year‚Äôs COP26 in Glasgow was considered a success, governments have since been preoccupied with the war in Ukraine and inflation, and haven‚Äôt been following through on their climate pledges. So the mood entering the summit is pretty sour. Ultimately, though, the energy shock caused by the war in Ukraine could speed up the transition to renewables, according to the world‚Äôs top energy agency.

Despite Covid cases leveling off in the last few weeks, experts worry that as people start to party like it‚Äôs 2019 and holiday travel revs up, respiratory infections that are already making their way through the US could continue to surge. Flu hospitalization rates are currently at their highest since 2010, according to the CDC.

They pounced on rumors this week that Beijing was thinking about relaxing its draconian Covid precautions, sending Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index to its best week in a decade. Separately, Reuters obtained a recording of a former Chinese disease control official telling a conference that China would be making big changes to its ‚Äúdynamic-zero‚Äù Covid policy.
