# üá∫üá∏ Good Morning
On Veterans Day, we want to express our deep gratitude to all those who have served in the US military.

-   **Here‚Äôs one factoid:**¬†Gulf War-era veterans now make up the largest share of US veterans, having surpassed Vietnam-era veterans in 2016.
-   **And another:**¬†The share of veterans who are women is projected to increase significantly, from 11% currently to 18% in 2046.

On a logistical note, most banks are closed today, but the stock market is open.

# News of the day - Inflation is coming down y‚Äôall
Like edibles, interest rate hikes take a while to kick in. But when they do, you can definitely feel the effects.

Yesterday‚Äôs¬†[inflation report](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29665268.3687013/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW5mbGF0aW9uLXVuaXRlZC1zdGF0ZXMtZWNvbm9teS1idXNpbmVzcy1jb25zdW1lci1wcmljZXMtMDM5ZDgyOWI4NzRiZTYyMzcwNDFlNWYwYWIwMzJhZDE_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB24a0e41d)¬†showed that US consumer price growth came in lower than expected in October and dropped from the month before. It‚Äôs a hopeful sign that Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs rate hikes, paired with easing supply chain snags, are starting to cool off inflation.

The deets:

-   The consumer price index increased 7.7% annually and 0.4% monthly. That yearly figure is the slowest rate since January.
-   But more important is the slowdown in core CPI, which is a better gauge of inflation because it strips out volatile food and gas prices. Core CPI rose 0.3% monthly in October, a big drop from 0.6% in September and August.

## What‚Äôs pushing inflation lower?

Prices of¬†_goods_¬†are slowing down considerably, led by declines in apparel and used cars (sorry, Carvana). Economists had been expecting goods inflation to chill out now that supply chain bottlenecks have been cleared, and it‚Äôs encouraging to see that show up in the data.

Inflation in¬†_service_-based industries is historically a tougher nut to crack, but even there prices cooled as airfares, sporting event tickets, and medical care became cheaper. And while shelter prices remain painfully high, private-sector data has shown that rental and housing costs are decreasing in the US (it‚Äôll just take time for that to show up in CPI).

***Buzz Killington enters the chat.***¬†While inflation could be on the comedown, a 7.7% rate of inflation is significantly higher than the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, so don‚Äôt expect J-Pow to stop hiking rates anytime soon. Also, you don‚Äôt have to be a statistics prof to know that a one-month sample size is too small to draw any broad conclusions from‚Äîmore data is needed to prove this cooling off is actually a trend.

**Bottom line:**¬†Coming after the Phillies loss in the World Series, October‚Äôs CPI report inches up the probability that the economy could glide to a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù after this inflation shock.‚Äî_NF_

**üá∫üá∏¬†Election update:**¬†The balance of power in DC became only a bit clearer yesterday as votes continue to be counted in competitive House and Senate races. The GOP appears on track to eke out a win in the House, but they still need to win two of the three outstanding Senate races to gain control of that chamber. Meanwhile, in a surprisingly close House race in Colorado, Democrat Adam Frisch and incumbent GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert are separated by a razor-thin margin that could trigger a recount.
