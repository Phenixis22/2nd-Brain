It‚Äôs Election Day. A quick reminder if you‚Äôre among the lucky few who have managed to avoid hearing from people who approve this message this midterm season: Control of both the House and Senate‚Äîcurrently held by Democrats‚Äîis [up for grabs](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29622665.3660018/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8xMC8yMy9hLXN1cGVyLXF1aWNrLXByZXZpZXctb2YtdGhlLW1pZHRlcm0tZWxlY3Rpb25zP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcmbWlkPTIzMGRmNzAyNDdkOTY2NmQwMzQwOTgwOWNlNTE2NGRk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB7bd13ed4). To shift the balance of power, Republicans need to pick up five seats in the House or just one in the Senate.

And that‚Äôs just at the federal level. Several states also have contentious questions on their ballots:

-   Abortion will be put to a vote in five states. Proposed constitutional amendments in California, Michigan, and Vermont would establish a right to abortion, while a proposed change in Kentucky would state that its constitution doesn‚Äôt protect that right. In Montana, voters will weigh whether to require medical treatment for an infant that survives an attempted pregnancy termination.
-   Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota, and South Dakota are all considering whether to legalize recreational marijuana as 19 other states have. In Colorado, where even the mountains are high, voters will decide whether to legalize psychedelic mushrooms for medical purposes.
-   Slavery might be an issue you thought we settled back in 1865, but Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont will ask voters whether to outlaw it in their state. Why? Prison reform advocates are hoping the bans, which have passed in some other states, could help end forced prison labor.

**The results could take a while‚Ä¶**experts say it‚Äôs unlikely that a news anchor standing in front of a giant map will be able to give us all the answers on who won before we go to bed [tonight](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29622665.3660018/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9qZWN0cy5maXZldGhpcnR5ZWlnaHQuY29tL3doZW4tZWxlY3Rpb24tcmVzdWx0cy0yMDIyLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB49f91564) thanks to the rise in voting by mail, as well as close races where legal challenges are expected (and, in some cases, already underway) or runoff votes are possible.
