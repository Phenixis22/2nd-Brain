# Good Morning
Little did we know that our crypto newsletter would launch just weeks before the industry‚Äôs biggest blowup ever. Good (?) timing.

If you want to read more about the FTX debacle and what it means for the sector, check out our new crypto newsletter, [Incrypto](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29696576.3649313/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2luY3J5cHRvL3N1YnNjcmliZT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249aWNfaW5fbWJfMTExNDIyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWNyb3NzcHJvbW8mbWlkPTIzMGRmNzAyNDdkOTY2NmQwMzQwOTgwOWNlNTE2NGRk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB49d8e2e9), which is diving much deeper into this unfolding saga than we have space for here.

The $32 billion FTX implosion is already on the Hollywood fast track. Nonfiction superstar author Michael Lewis, who is famous for writing¬†_The Big Short_¬†and¬†_Moneyball_, has reportedly been¬†[embedded](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29696576.3649313/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVhbmtsZXIuY29tL3AvaHdvb2QtZnR4LWZyZW56eS1hcy1taWNoYWVsLWxld2lzP3NkPXBm/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB450484d1)¬†with the bankrupt crypto exchange‚Äôs former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for six months and will pen a book telling the inside story.

News of Lewis‚Äôs next book was revealed by a CAA agent in an email to potential buyers of the movie rights. ‚ÄúThe story has become too big for us to wait,‚Äù the email said. Lewis hasn‚Äôt written anything yet, but given recent events, you have to imagine he has a few ideas for sentences. According to the email, the author plans to focus on the rivalry between SBF and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), whom he likens to the ‚ÄúLuke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto.‚Äù

Lewis has a knack for telling stories about industry shifts using eccentric characters. SBF, a 30-year-old (former) crypto billionaire who once implied he would donate $1 billion to political races, claimed he was ‚Äúskeptical of books,‚Äù and had dreams of buying Goldman Sachs, certainly fits the mold.

**Further reading:**¬†In our interview with Lewis back in February, the author referred to the excesses of the crypto industry as ‚Äúalmost performing a satire‚Äù of capitalist systems.¬†[Read the full interview here](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29696576.3649313/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3N0b3JpZXMvaWNlYnJlYWtlcnMtd2l0aC1hdXRob3ItbWljaGFlbC1sZXdpcz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3Jm1pZD0yMzBkZjcwMjQ3ZDk2NjZkMDM0MDk4MDljZTUxNjRkZA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB90475120).‚Äî_MK_
