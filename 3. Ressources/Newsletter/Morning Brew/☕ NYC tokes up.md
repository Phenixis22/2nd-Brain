President Biden continued the bizarre White House Thanksgiving tradition of pardoning turkeys yesterday when he absolved two large birds, Chocolate and Chip, of their crime of being large birds.

Why is this a thing? The simplest answer is always the correct one: It‚Äôs a¬†[PR stunt](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29767637.3228934/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy8yMDE5LzExLzI2Lzc4MjcxNjY4OC9pLWJlZy15b3VyLXBhcmRvbi10aGUtc3RyYW5nZS1oaXN0b3J5LXByZXNpZGVudHMtc3BhcmluZy10dXJrZXlzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBca95c8d9)¬†by Big Turkey, according to NPR. Since 1947, the National Turkey Federation lobbying group has provided turkeys to presidents to raise awareness for the industry. Initially, these turkeys were intended to be eaten, but in 1963 President Kennedy became the first on record to ‚Äúpardon‚Äù one.

**Fun fact:**¬†The National Turkey Federation is among the top 5% of outside groups that have donated to US political causes.

# News of the day - Soon you‚Äôll finally be able to buy weed in New York

That‚Äôs kind of a joke‚Äîmost New Yorkers know that you can already buy marijuana on practically every city block. But next month it can be done legally.

The state, which legalized recreational cannabis back in March 2021, awarded its first 36 retail¬†[licenses](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29767637.3228934/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3eW9yay5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYXJpanVhbmEtZGlzcGVuc2FyaWVzLW55Yy1maW5kLWxvY2F0aW9uLW5lYXItbWUtbGVnYWwtd2VlZC1zdGF0ZS1wb3QtY2FubmFiaXMtcmVjcmVhdGlvbmFsLWFkdWx0LXVzZS8zOTY2NDcxLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB556fbbc1)¬†yesterday, prioritizing sellers impacted by the drug‚Äôs former illicit status. There‚Äôs still another round of paperwork ahead, but New York has said it expects the first dispensaries to open their doors in December.

## What took so long?

Red tape mostly, but also good intentions. Part of the delay in issuing licenses to sellers after the law passed and growers got permission to get started was New York‚Äôs effort to have its burgeoning legal cannabis market help out those harmed by the war on drugs.

Under a special equity program, 150 of the first licenses will be made available to individuals with prior marijuana convictions or their family members, and 25 are reserved for nonprofits.

-   For the licenses granted yesterday, 28 individuals or LLCs and eight nonprofits were selected from a pool of 900.

Still, if the program works as anticipated (despite a lawsuit that‚Äôs delayed it even further in some areas), it will give the communities most affected by past crackdowns on marijuana a chance to benefit from the new status quo, rather than big companies that have swooped in from other states.

## But New York already has a black market for weed

And it‚Äôs huge: One estimate puts its size at ~$2 billion. That‚Äôs a lot of competition for the newly minted legal sellers, and it‚Äôs competition that doesn‚Äôt have to worry about things like taxes or getting product from approved vendors.

What‚Äôs more, after the law decriminalizing weed passed, a huge gray market of ‚Äúweed bodegas‚Äù and weed trucks, where cannabis is openly displayed and sold, sprang up in New York City.

**Bottom line:**¬†Without new efforts to halt illegal sales, it‚Äôs not clear whether legal sellers will really have a leg up in a crowded field._‚ÄîAR_

Orion‚Äôs journey is a key step in the space agency‚Äôs Artemis program, which aims to send humans back to the moon for the first time since 1972. If all goes according to plan, the next orbital flight will have astronauts aboard and will happen as early as 2024. Before the end of the decade, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to be sending people down to the surface and they‚Äôre going to be living on that surface,‚Äù asserted NASA Program Manager Howard Hu, who oversaw Orion‚Äôs launch.

Paramount had planned to appeal the decision, but instead it will shell out $200 million for a termination fee. Simon & Schuster is still up for sale, though, if anyone needs a good Christmas gift for a book lover.

Stat: Soccer legend Cristiano Ronaldo may be bickering with his club, Manchester United, but he still became the first person to hit 500 million Instagram followers yesterday. Now, the only account in existence with more followers than Ronaldo is the actual Instagram Instagram account‚Ä¶the only account that forces everyone to watch its stories. Ronaldo was pushed over the threshold by a Louis Vuitton ad he posted of himself playing chess with Lionel Messi (who has the third-most followed Instagram account, with 376 million followers).

Quote: ‚ÄúMy firstborn child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics, or fame.‚Äù

Elon Musk made it clear on Sunday that while he took over Twitter as a ‚Äúfree speech absolutist‚Äù and he‚Äôs down to allow Donald Trump, Kanye West, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and other people whose accounts were suspended back on the platform, he does draw the line somewhere‚Äîand that somewhere is at Alex Jones of Infowars. Jones repeatedly insisted that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, and he‚Äôs been ordered to pay nearly $1 billion to families impacted by the tragedy.
