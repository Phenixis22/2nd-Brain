# Good Morning
The Houston Astros no-hit the Phillies to tie up the World Series at 2‚Äì2 last night, which means Mattress Mack is inching closer to making sports gambling history.

Jim ‚ÄúMattress Mack‚Äù McIngvale, a Texas furniture mogul known for placing huge bets on sports, has wagered about $10 million on the Astros to win the World Series. If they do win, he‚Äôll earn almost $75 million‚Äîthe largest payout on a legal sports bet ever in the US. ‚ÄúI have a high tolerance for risk,‚Äù Mack says.

Netflix released its newest original comedy,¬†_Blockbuster_, today. The show is about the last remaining branded video rental store‚Äîwhich feels a little personal, since Netflix helped¬†[stamp out](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29574894.3975668/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90aGUtcmlzZS1hbmQtZmFsbC1vZi1ibG9ja2J1c3Rlci12aWRlby1zdHJlYW1pbmctMjAyMC0xP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB86c9ed27)¬†its once-dominant competitor.

At Blockbuster‚Äôs peak, the movie rental chain had 9,000 stores and raked in $6 billion in annual revenue, mainly from our¬†_10 Things I Hate About You_¬†late fees.

But in the late ‚Äô90s, Blockbuster passed on the chance to buy Netflix for $50 million. Not a great call, since the company is now worth over $120 billion.

Instead, Blockbuster partnered with Enron to create its own video-on-demand platform. In 2001, the chain abandoned the project, thinking the future of the industry would still involve blue-carpeted video rental stores. Over the next decade Blockbuster couldn‚Äôt keep up with Netflix and filed for bankruptcy. As of 2018 only one store, more of a shrine to the way things were than an actual business, remains in Bend, Oregon.

**And now‚Ä¶**Netflix, the once scrappy underdog that defeated Blockbuster, is back to hustling as it strives to set itself apart from other streaming services. The company rolled out its first ad-supported tier today to juice flagging subscriber numbers.‚Äî_MM_
