# Good Morning
Got a thought experiment to kick off your Friday morning: Which piece of movie memorabilia would you pay an exorbitant amount for?

Reason we‚Äôre asking is that there‚Äôs a massive pop culture memorabilia auction going on right now. Among the items for sale are the Holy Bible from¬†_The Shawshank Redemption_, Darth Vader‚Äôs gloves from¬†_Star Wars: A New Hope_, and Marty McFly‚Äôs hoverboard from¬†_Back to the Future Part II_.

And by ‚Äúexorbitant amount,‚Äù here‚Äôs a price benchmark: The volleyball prop Tom Hanks called Wilson in¬†_Cast Away_¬†just sold for $83,828.

In the span of a few hours yesterday, these headlines flashed across our screens:

-   Amazon pauses hiring for its corporate workforce.
-   Lyft is cutting 13% of its workforce.
-   Dapper Labs, the NFT company behind NBA Top Shot, is laying off 22% of its workforce.

But in this story, we‚Äôre going to focus on a fourth headline: Stripe¬†[lays off 14%](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29588147.3700852/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wMy9zdHJpcGUtcGxhbnMtdG8tbGF5LW9mZi0xNHBlcmNlbnQtb2Ytd29ya2Vycy5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB89be081b)¬†of its workforce.

Why that one? Because Stripe‚Äôs CEO offered an unusually blunt and detailed explanation for the job cuts, giving us a window into how tech companies are grappling with what is potentially the dot-com bust 2.0.

**First, what is Stripe?**¬†It‚Äôs a Silicon Valley payments giant run by billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Collison. And in a sea of unicorns in 2021, Stripe‚Äôs horn shined the brightest. It rode the Covid fintech wave to a $95 billion valuation that March, making it the most valuable startup in the US.

## That‚Äôs where the problems began

In his¬†[memo](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29588147.3700852/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJpcGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tL25ld3MvY2VvLXBhdHJpY2stY29sbGlzb25zLWVtYWlsLXRvLXN0cmlwZS1lbXBsb3llZXM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB47519056)¬†to employees announcing the layoffs yesterday, Collison said Stripe leadership made two errors:

1. They were ‚Äúmuch too optimistic‚Äù about the growth of the internet economy in 2022 and 2023.

-   Remember, in March 2021, every retailer was expanding its online shopping biz, which benefited Stripe immensely as a payments processor.
-   Its CFO¬†[boasted](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29588147.3700852/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maW50ZWNoLXN0cmlwZS1zY29yZXMtYmxvY2tidXN0ZXItOTUtYmlsbGlvbi12YWx1YXRpb24tMTE2MTU3NjMyMDk_bW9kPWFydGljbGVfaW5saW5l/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB5387e012)¬†to the WSJ that Stripe was bigger now than the entire e-commerce sector in 2010, when the company was founded.

2. That optimism led to the next error in judgment: Feeling like its hot streak was never going to end, Stripe grew its operating costs too quickly, and got sloppy. ‚ÄúWe overhired for the world we‚Äôre in,‚Äù Collison wrote.

## The world we‚Äôre in

As Stripe daydreamed of a future where people bumped elbows and DoorDashed every meal, 2022 gave it a wakeup call. Inflation soared, the Fed hiked interest rates, Putin invaded Ukraine, and as a result, Stripe‚Äôs growth trajectory looked a lot more horizontal than it did peak-Covid. Which means it‚Äôs time to hit ‚Äúreset,‚Äù Collison wrote.

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**more tech layoffs are imminent. Elon Musk will begin cutting half of Twitter‚Äôs workforce today.‚Äî_NF_

On Wednesday, Irving and the Nets each donated $500,000 to anti-hate causes‚Äîbut without a full apology to match, the Nets say he is ‚Äúunfit‚Äù to be associated with the team.

üáÆüá±¬†**Israel moves to the right.**¬†Benjamin Netanyahu told Lula ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù and pulled off a major political comeback of his own this week. In Israel‚Äôs fifth election in four years, Netanyahu‚Äôs nationalist and religious alliance¬†[secured](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29588147.3700852/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LTYzNDkwODA2P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBaa87ec18)¬†a parliamentary majority, putting Netanyahu in the driver‚Äôs seat to return as prime minister of Israel within weeks. This bloc will form one of Israel‚Äôs most right-wing governments in its history, and the most cohesive government since 2019.

üá¨üáß¬†**The UK could enter its worst recession ever.**¬†So said the Bank of England (BOE), which¬†[hiked interest rates](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29588147.3700852/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLTYzNDcxNzI1P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB09550d6d)¬†by the most in 33 years yesterday to quell soaring inflation. BOE head Andrew Bailey warned that UK households faced a ‚Äútough road ahead,‚Äù with unemployment doubling by 2025. But, echoing his American counterpart Jerome Powell, he said failing to take bold action now would result in worse outcomes later on.
