# Good Morning
 If you open your laptop in the next few days to find a morning brew, it’ll only be because you spilled coffee everywhere. We are off through the rest of Thanksgiving week to spend time with our families and explain the FTX collapse to them.

# News of the day - Thanksgiving air travel will never be the same
![Travelers at an airport](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/fvdz3IcYCgxRI1tKFcDtFrS8dSxyYdgNE0j8s4PMC5R6JiJ82fy58qrM0IGdq7pSV_kyuFcVFzANP0gHDitGs5dFo7YdP7guwOSlrm4sE1iNfRT88J-h2gQTRvynWL4SL6CCetSE7m1bln-2rNI1hsc95JlaEzShwVxxn2YCmD6X_mARNWZt0JZU3ME_0zNCKg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/815440b930e72789155b693733daa86b736de536-1500x1000.jpg?w=670&q=70&auto=format)]_Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images_

It’s the day before Thanksgiving, and you’re probably scrambling to fire off emails before joining a crowd of other travelers at the airport heading home for the holiday.

Or…maybe you’re already at home, leisurely tapping at your keyboard from the couch while the smell of pumpkin pie wafts in from the kitchen. In this age of hybrid work, typical holiday travel schedules are being [upended](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29780555.3652900/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHJhdmVsLWhlYWx0aC1jb3ZpZC1idXNpbmVzcy1jMTkzNzE0ZGFmY2UwYTM3YjFmMWRjMWJlMjIyYjFlOT9yZWY9Yml6dG9jLmNvbQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBcbaac34f) as employees, unchained from the office, make travel plans on their own terms.

## What are the effects of this shift?

For one, airlines are expecting less of a mad rush during what traditionally have been peak Thanksgiving travel times and more of a low boil across the entire week. That appears to be playing out: On both Sunday and Monday, more people passed through TSA checkpoints than they did on the same days in 2019.

**It’s also making life easier for airlines _and_ passengers.** Airlines say their businesses are easier to run when the chart of travel demand looks less like the Rockies and more like the Plains. “We’re seeing demand is more spread out…I see it all over the place, and that bodes well,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom [said](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29780555.3652900/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNi9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1jZW8tb24tdGFja2xpbmctdGhlLW5ldy10cmF2ZWwtcGF0dGVybnMvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6cd63538) at the Skift Aviation Forum. And for passengers, more work flexibility = more opportunity to snag lower-priced tickets at odd times.

Overall, the travel industry is bullish on a future where the line separating business and leisure travel is increasingly blurred (call it “bleisure,” if you can handle the cringe). With 35% of all business trips now [including a weekend](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29780555.3652900/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9uZXctcmVwb3J0LXNob3dzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXRyYXZlbC1vbi10aGUtcmlzZS10aGlzLWZhbGw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldyZtaWQ9MjMwZGY3MDI0N2Q5NjY2ZDAzNDA5ODA5Y2U1MTY0ZGQ/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBdfa5cd6b), airline execs say that they can capitalize as long as they better understand when people are flying in this new normal.

Any normalization would be welcome in an industry that’s been shaken up the past few years—first by Covid keeping everyone at home, then through getting overrun by the rebound in travelers once the world opened back up.

**Price check:** Airfares are really expensive this fall. Peak prices for a domestic Thanksgiving round-trip flight will top more than $450, and prices for Christmas flights are at a five-year high, per Hopper.—_NF_

There have been more delays on this deadline (eight) than there are planned _Avatar_ sequels, but Biden doesn’t want to resume the payments until his plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student debt per borrower conquers the many legal challenges it’s facing. Last week, a federal court blocked Biden’s plan from going into effect, and earlier this month a Texas federal judge deemed the debt forgiveness unlawful.

But if this was indeed a fiefdom before, it’s now a barren village. A “substantial amount” of FTX’s assets “have either been stolen or are missing,” an attorney said, adding, “We have probably witnessed one of the most abrupt and difficult corporate collapses in the history of corporate America.”

**Stat:** Saudi Arabia beat Argentina 2–1 yesterday in one of the most [shocking upsets](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29780555.3652900/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd29ybGQtY3VwLXNvY2Nlci1zcG9ydHMtYXJnZW50aW5hLXFhdGFyLTViMDI4ODQwMjViOGY4NmQ2MjEzOTk5ZTNhZjVlODc5P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXBuZXdzJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZmVhdHVyZWRjYXJkJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1sZWFkc3Rvcnk/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBe74f4530) in World Cup history. Just how improbable was it?

And 51st-ranked Saudi Arabia was an 18–1 to 20–1 underdog in the match, meaning if you had bet $100 on the Saudis to win, you would’ve made up to $2,000. It’s yet another World Cup setback for Argentine star Lionel Messi, who has never won the tournament despite being one of the best to ever play the game.

**Quote:** “My final message—maybe the final message I give you from this podium—is that, please, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated Covid-19 shot as soon as you’re eligible, to protect yourself, your family, and your community.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci urged Americans to get their reformulated Covid boosters in his [final White House press briefing](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29780555.3652900/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMjIvZmF1Y2ktbGFzdC1wcmVzcy1icmllZmluZy1jb3ZpZD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBfa92d7d0) yesterday. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official and the leader of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, announced this summer that he’d be stepping down to “pursue the next chapter” of his career in December. Fauci’s plea comes as public health officials warn that a “viral jumbalaya” of respiratory infections threatens to push hospitals to the brink this winter.
