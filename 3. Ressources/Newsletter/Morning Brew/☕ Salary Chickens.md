# Good Morning
Spooky season has officially ended, and whatever the period in between Halloween and Thanksgiving is called has begun (light coat-a-thon?). Whatever you want to name it, it‚Äôs going to be hella busy.

-   The midterms are one week from today.
-   _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_¬†arrives Friday the 11th.
-   The World Cup begins on the 20th.
-   A 16-pound Thanksgiving turkey needs to start thawing the 21st, latest.

If you work in New York City, you can celebrate Marked-Down-Halloween-Candy Day by comparing your salary to your future coworkers‚Äô. Today a new city law goes into effect that requires companies with four or more employees to disclose a specific¬†[pay range](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29550149.3642934/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8zMS9zYWxhcnktcmFuZ2VzLWFyZS1jb21pbmctdG8tbnljLWpvYi1hZHMtb24tbm92LTFoZXJlcy13aGF0LXRvLWtub3cuaHRtbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB6128a678)¬†in every job posting.

Several states including Colorado, California, and Washington have already passed similar transparency laws, with more on the horizon.

Supporters of salary transparency laws say the rules will help close racial and gender pay gaps. Even businesses that initially pushed back against the NYC law, calling it another hurdle in a tight labor market, are now submitting to the inevitable pay transparency wave.

**It doesn‚Äôt matter where a job is posted:**¬†Internal or external sites, flyers, classified ads‚Äîeven if a job opening is yelled out in the middle of Times Square by the town crier, it will need a salary range. Indeed said it won‚Äôt post any NYC-based roles that don‚Äôt include salary ranges as of today.

The law is expected to affect 4 million private-sector employees: It covers full- and part-time roles, internships, and independent contractors.

## Even if you don‚Äôt live in NYC, you‚Äôll start to see changes

If an NYC-based company is hiring for a remote role outside of the Big Apple, it won‚Äôt technically need to include the salary info. But companies hiring all over the country are now likely to slap salary ranges on every job. Corporations like American Express and Citigroup have already started doing just that. And a majority of workplaces are seriously considering it, according to a¬†[survey](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29550149.3642934/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMTAtMzEvYW1leC1qb2lucy1maXJtcy1wb3N0aW5nLXNhbGFyeS1yYW5nZXMtZm9yLWFsbC11cy1qb2ItcG9zdGluZ3M_c3JuZD1wcmVtaXVtJnNyZWY9S2tQenBadnombGVhZFNvdXJjZT11dmVyaWZ5JTIwd2FsbA/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB0cd14abe)¬†from consulting firm Willis Towers Watson.
