# Good Morning
Happy 30th birthday to texting! On this day 30 years ago, the first SMS message was sent.

Thirty years is a long time, but what if texting had been around throughout human history? Maybe some of these messages would have been sent‚Ä¶

-   Cleopatra to Mark Antony: ‚Äúu up‚Äù
-   Francis Scott Key to his buddy: ‚Äúdoes ‚Äòrockets‚Äô red glare‚Äô sound dumb??‚Äù
-   Juliet to Romeo: ‚Äúhey gonna pretend to be dead don‚Äôt freak out‚Äù (*message could not be sent)

Just a few corny jokes on a Saturday morning. Have a great weekend!

# News of the day - US shows off new bomber jet
![The B-21 Raider stealth bomber](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LRJE_p0dlaM1H4E6OKGQGGYa-yHuRXWUipG3q4USxNWd3EOdcs_03TUfZ7iF6gNWxCy6S3p06J68D5EmMZpVyWXqrsDufTPaIZ8o3AI2zirndN1_5RbpRT6bHVAUk_x4R6lYbcJ_0aG6LBLzuj58MoHkl-ICl-E6cRMQObk1ATin1XeKSzDbHQkqkNgR0us=s0-d-e1-ft#https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/0bbf8b136a535eb49150373f25afb4352cf3438b-750x500.jpg?w=670&q=70&auto=format)

The Pentagon flashed its brand-new stealth nuclear bomber, the B-21 Raider, at a public unveiling event yesterday. The sleek stingray-shaped aircraft looks like a vessel straight out of¬†_Star Wars_¬†and is estimated to have cost around ~$750 million to build.

Developed in secret by Northrop Grumman over the past decade, the B-21 is the first new US bomber to be unveiled since the Cold War ended. The US wants to order 100 of the jets. The new fleet would represent a pivot in American defense manufacturing away from anti-terrorism capabilities toward equipment for a potential war against a powerful adversary, like China or Russia.¬†

Amid growing tensions in US‚ÄìChina relations, the latter is quickly expanding its nuclear arsenal, and the Pentagon expects China will possess 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. The public reveal of the new bomber is part of the US effort to keep up with that potential threat.

**Bottom line:**¬†While the B-21 was designed to deliver nuclear and conventional weapons in stealth mode (with or without a pilot), the US clearly hopes that any potential foes saw the unveiling of the plane, which Northrop Grumman described as ‚Äúa visible and flexible deterrent.‚Äù_‚ÄîSK_

Jones already put his company Free Speech Systems into bankruptcy back in July. Attorneys for the families have criticized the moves as attempts to wriggle out of paying what he owes them.

Russia previously warned it would retaliate against any price cap. However, the current one may be mostly symbolic, as it would still allow Russia to turn a profit. The EU and the UK will also ban imports of Russian oil on Monday, so the cap, which prohibits shippers and insurers from handling Russian oil sold for more, will impact what Russia can get from the rest of the market.

And while it‚Äôs no surprise that ‚Äúsense of humor‚Äù was one of the top qualities daters were searching for in potential hookup partners, something actually stood out: Many swipers also want someone who‚Äôs into politics. Almost half of the singles (47%) said that finding out the person they‚Äôre dating doesn‚Äôt vote would be a dealbreaker. Perhaps reflecting the allure of political engagement, the Ukrainian flag was almost as popular to include in your profile as a shirtless pic next to a tiger. It broke into the top 10 emojis included in bios this year.

The coolers have started washing up on the beach by the hundreds after the company lost 1,600 of them when cargo containers fell off a ship near British Columbia circa October 2021. The company is taking the accidental finders-keepers giveaway in stride, with CEO Matt Reintjes saying he hopes the tempest-tossed coolers get put to ‚Äúgood use.‚Äù You might not even need to brave the icy shores to nab one‚Äîthere are reports that a pair of adventurous coolers made it all the way to Hawaii, and who knows where the ocean will send them next.
