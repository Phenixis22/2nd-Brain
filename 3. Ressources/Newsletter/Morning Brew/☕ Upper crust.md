# Good Morning
It‚Äôs December, which means that as of today you‚Äôre officially allowed to hang up Christmas lights without any judgment from your neighbors. Don‚Äôt just take our word for it: A recent survey of ~4,000 US homeowners found that Dec. 1 was the day most people identified as acceptable to put up Christmas lights.

OK, but what day is it acceptable to set out the holiday chili to appease Yeetch, the snow creature, so it doesn‚Äôt cut all the powerlines in your neighborhood?

# News of the day - Striker, no striking!

With a potentially economically devastating nationwide rail strike looming in early December, the US House yesterday¬†[passed](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29851553.3616739/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8zMC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9yYWlsLXdvcmtlcnMtc3RyaWtlLWhvdXNlLmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/6360d8c913646a717506c2efB445610de)¬†a resolution that would force rail worker unions to accept a tentative agreement with management and make any strikes illegal.

In a 290‚Äì137 bipartisan vote, the House approved the resolution just a day after President Biden urged congressional leaders to avert a strike. A second resolution that passed with support from just three Republicans would grant rail workers seven days of paid sick leave (a major sticking point in the negotiations).

The vote marks the first time Congress has flexed its power to block a national rail strike since the 1990s. Back then, President Biden was one of six senators to oppose the bill that ended a 1992 rail strike, arguing against government interference in labor.

## What gives Congress a say anyway?

Normally, Congress can‚Äôt intervene too heavily in private labor disputes. But since the US economy is so dependent on rail, the Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 to give the House and Senate the authority to prevent a national strike. It was expanded to include airline workers in the 1930s.

The impact really would be significant: Estimates say a strike would cost the US economy about $2 billion a day, and its ripple effects could include global food shortages.

Because there‚Äôs so much at stake economically, rail workers have huge power to effect change. The eight-hour workday and Labor Day are both results of past rail strikes.

**What‚Äôs next?**¬†The Senate is expected to vote on the resolutions soon, since a strike could effectively start as early as this weekend. Both measures will require the support of 60 senators, which some lawmakers say is less likely for the sick leave provision. On Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted in support of rail workers, claiming he would block legislation until a vote occurred on the seven sick day resolution.‚Äî_MK_
