# Good Morning
It takes a particularly heinous act of Mother Nature to impact a Buffalo Bills football game, but the weather forecast is so horrendous that the team‚Äôs home matchup vs. the Cleveland Browns on Sunday has been moved to Detroit.

The forecast: The Buffalo area could get up to five feet of snow over the next couple days due to an ‚Äúextreme‚Äù lake-effect storm. New York has already declared a state of emergency for 11 counties, and 350+ plows, 5,700 utility crews, and the National Guard will be on hand to clean up the mess when it‚Äôs over early Saturday morning.

Stay safe, Bills Mafia.

# News of the day - The guy who unwound Enron looking at FTX‚Äôs books
Veteran bankruptcy pro John J. Ray III, the newly appointed FTX CEO, said the collapsed crypto exchange was the¬†[worst corporate failure](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29733879.3597905/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMTEtMTcvaGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLWNyYXppZXN0LXBhcnRzLWZyb20tdGhlLW5ldy1mdHgtYmFua3J1cHRjeS1maWxpbmc_c3JlZj1La1B6cFp2eg/6360d8c913646a717506c2efBd3e11fa1)¬†he‚Äôs ever witnessed. And he oversaw the liquidation of Enron.

Here‚Äôs some of what Ray wrote in an absolutely bonkers bankruptcy filing yesterday:

-   ‚ÄúI have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience. I have been the Chief Restructuring Officer or Chief Executive Officer in several of the largest corporate failures in history. I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance (Enron).‚Äù
-   ‚ÄúNearly every situation in which I have been involved has been characterized by defects of some sort in internal controls, regulatory compliance, human resources and systems integrity.¬†**Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.**‚Äù¬†(Emphasis ours.)

## Why such a dumpster fire?

How long do you have? Here are just a few examples of the chaos and mismanagement that went on at FTX, as described by Ray.

**Lack of spending controls:**¬†FTX employees submitted payment requests through a chat platform, which were approved with personalized emojis. Some corporate funds were used to buy homes and personal items for employees and advisors, according to Ray.

**Nonexistent records:**¬†Speaking of FTX employees, Ray said his team is having a hard time piecing together just who worked at the company because they couldn‚Äôt find an official roster. Furthermore, there are no records of major business decisions made by FTX because former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly made those using auto-deleting messages.

Finally, Ray really wants you to know that SBF has¬†_nothing_¬†to do with the company anymore. In his tweets and conversations with the press, SBF has continued to make ‚Äúerratic and misleading public statements,‚Äù and he does not speak for the current iteration of FTX, according to Ray.

Think we could all use a cold shower after that story. Moving on‚Ä¶‚Äî_NF_

She‚Äôs not leaving DC completely, though‚Äîshe plans to continue representing San Francisco in Congress.
