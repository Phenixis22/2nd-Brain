# 🏗️ **1. Prolific Beats Perfect**

The point of creating content (from a business perspective) is so that your audience develops a connection with you.

People increasingly want to buy things from **other people**, not faceless corporations. And the way to inspire people and deepen that relationship with them is through being prolific. Create things weekly, daily, finish projects quickly.

The more you create, the higher your chances of making that **one video** or blog post that strikes a chord.

In other words, quantity beats quality.

Take the Beatles, for example. They wrote on average one song every ~8 days for 12 years, and often **multiple** albums in a year. They didn’t spend years agonising over every little detail - but their songs are still legendary. If they’d been perfectionists, they probably wouldn’t have gotten as far as they did.

The point is - don’t don’t set your quality bar too high. Just get out there and create.

# ⏳ **2. Content is Time Travel**

This is really true.

For example, Dan wrote his book [Key Person of Influence](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluqd83z0psnh4d7x2daz/8ghqhohg8844x6bl/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL3hDemc=) 12 years ago. And all these years later, Chris Do read it, vibed with the ideas, and invited Dan onto his podcast.

So in a way, Dan-from-12-years-ago communicated with modern-day Chris in a time-travelly kind of way. And it let to new opportunities, with the two guys chatting on a podcast, becoming friends, and potentially working together on a business.

So remember - with every piece of content you put out there (especially on a platform with longevity, like YouTube or a blog), you’re leaving a breadcrumb trail that will lead interesting people to you in the future.
