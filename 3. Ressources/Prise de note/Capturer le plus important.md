Most people don't have high enough standards for what they save in their notetaking app.

And as a result, they get buried under a mountain of notes, discouraged to use any of them (and that's the most important part).

So, here's my recommendation:

**Don't capture what you can easily google.**

It doesn't make much sense to note down the population of France, in case you need that information someday. You can just look up the latest number in a heartbeat.

**Instead, capture what**Â **_resonates_****.**

Now, what does that mean? It means that the information you want to save triggered something inside you. They inspired you, surprised you, and even provoked you. You can google facts, but you can't google a feeling.

**Take action**: This week, listen to your body whenever you want to save something in your notetaking app.
