![[Tiago Forte - quotes#^2]]

Get fixated on productivity to the exclusion of everything else, and your work starts to feel stale and formulaic.

That’s when you need to **get creative.**

Do something new. Surprise yourself. Start working on that outrageous idea you had back in March 2022, but never acted on because you were ‘too busy’.

But it’s also possible to swing **too** far towards creativity.

That’s when you get too precious about your work, and everything has to be special and unique. When that happens, meaningful progress quickly grinds to a halt under the weight of expectation.

That’s your sign to **get productive** again. Identify what you do well. Then create a system that lets you do that thing consistently, efficiently, and to a good standard.
