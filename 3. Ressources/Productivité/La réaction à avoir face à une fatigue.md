Something unusual happened to me this December.

One Sunday I woke up and just… didn’t feel like doing anything.

Not working on my business, not filming YouTube videos. Not even something actively recharging (like going for a walk).

I'm usually pumped for the day ahead. But this time my brain just said: _Meh, why bother getting up?_

If you’re a long-term Sunday Snippets reader, you know I like to apply the [Reitoff Principle](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu37xo8l4f9hok3lwwup/8ghqhohg89mo88al/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3RoZS1yZWl0b2ZmLXByaW5jaXBsZS1mb3ItcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5Lw==) in these situations:

_If there’s a day where I get home from work a little late and I’m feeling pretty tired, I’ll just write-off the evening and lounge on the sofa reading a book or getting through my backlog of Peter McKinnon and Matt D’Avella videos, completely guilt-free.

But this time I made **a crucial mistake**.

Instead of accepting the situation and devoting the next few days to Netflix, takeout, and light reading, I talked myself into ‘being productive’. _I have a book to write. Videos to film. This business won’t run itself._

What that **actually** looked like was me slumped at my desk, wrapped in a blanket with a mug of tea, doing a bunch of pseudo work + watching random video essays. Which lasted for about 5 days, until I woke up on Thursday feeling back to normal and ready to take on the world.

But if I’d applied the Reitoff Principle **from the beginning** I’d probably have recovered in ~2 days, and had a much better time.

Moral of the story: give yourself a break on days when you know you won’t be productive.
