# What is Mond Mode
period of immersion from 21 to 90 days long
More than 90 days will be too difficult and you'll have the feeling to lose your time
# Monk mode protocol
## 10mins a day meditation
In the 10 first days, you won't feel anything good that cameback from that
It'll begin around the 10th, 14th days
From this time, you'll begin to notide every bad states instead of just reach your phone and run away from your fears and problem
You'll notice your monkey brain, your demons but beautiful things will happen
You'll notice that you'll be more confident with yourself
You and you are the same team
## 30mins a day of exercise
You won't over training, you can just walk, swim, anything, but just exercise
![[Iman Gadzhi - quotes#^1]]
The two go hand in hand
Do some stretching, yoga, whatever but exercise
We're not supposed to sit, we'd hunt, move stretch, run walk, etc...
![[Iman Gadzhi - quotes#^2]]
