## Part 1 - Attract, don't chase

**I firmly believe that finding my life-partner starts internally rather than externally.**

This means that the first step is getting clear on who I need to become so I attract the woman of my dreams.

I’ve been working hard over the past few years and have gotten clear on my values, my purpose, and the life I am looking to build. 

I've had time to allow these discoveries to become a core part of who I am, not just "something I do."

And while we're all works in progress, I'm confident that I now embody these principles pretty well.

Now I'm ready to start putting myself out there more.

Because I know that I’m the type of man a high-caliber woman would want to be with.

**When building your own system, you always need to start with the end goal in mind.**

In this case I want to ultimately "attract" my ideal partner.

**Question to ask yourself: What do I want the end result to be?**

## Part 2 - Who’s My Target Market?

There are a lot of amazing women in the world, but that doesn’t mean I’d be a great fit for many of them.

I need to have an idea of the type of woman I want to be with, so I can be on the lookout for her.

The woman of my dreams:

-   **Is positive and optimistic.** She has a positive orientation, looks to seize the day and life, and doesn’t let bad vibes drag her down for long. She is compassionate and doesn’t constantly complain. She inspires me to be the best version of myself. 

-   **Is sexy.** She makes me feel alive, stimulated, lucky, and tingly. She has a great sense of taste and style.

-   **Has a growth mindset.** She’s a constant learner and has a vision for who she wants to become.

-   **Is passionate and secure in her path.** She has her own thing going on and loves things like art, design, and nature. She has some sort of lifelong passion that I can learn from and enjoy conversing with her about.

-   **Is the perfect road trip buddy.** She’s adventurous, not afraid to get dirty, spontaneous, loves to hike, and is positive and intellectually stimulating.

**When building your own system, you should try and keep it as simple as possible.**

Extremely complex systems have a lot of potential failure points.

Try to make each system as simple as possible. One goal and as few moving parts as possible.

**Ask yourself: How can I make this simple?**

## Part 3 - Where Can I Find Her?

People tend to hang out in certain places based on their interests and passions.

In the same way, I hope to attract a certain type of woman, **I need to spend time in places where my dream woman would be.**

This increases the likelihood that I'll have a "chance encounter" with the right person.

Where does my dream woman hang out? 

**She’s most likely hanging around a yoga studio or a cafe, not in a bar or a club.**

When building your own system, look for external tools or resources to help you accomplish your goal.

There's no use in reinventing the wheel. Odds are there are tools, resources or preexisting processes out there that can simplify your process and make it more efficient.

**Ask yourself: What tools or resources exist that can make this process better?**

## Part 4 - How Will I Get Her Attention?

Eventually as I continue to be proactive I will come across the perfect woman.

But that doesn’t mean anything if I can’t get her attention...

**How do I plan to get on her radar as a potential partner?**

By exemplifying my values.

By being vulnerable, not cocky.

By putting myself out there and taking a risk, not expecting her to do all the work.

And by becoming the best version of myself, not slacking off or making excuses for my behavior.

**When building your own system, determine what action needs to be taken to make the system work.**

It's easy to build a system that looks good on paper, but is practically unachievable in real life.

You always need to be aware of limitations within yourself or your team and build your system to work despite those limitations.

Otherwise you'll end up with a train wreck after a few weeks of implementation.

**Ask yourself: What action needs to be taken to accomplish this, and what are my limitations?**
