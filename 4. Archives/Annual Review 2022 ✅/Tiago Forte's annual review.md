Every time someone asks me, "What is the single most impactful thing I can do to achieve my goals?" my answer is always the same: 

Do an annual review.

The annual review is one of the most important, impactful exercises I've ever discovered. 

It’s the one time each year when anything is possible, when the future seems to hang in the air. It’s an incredible opportunity to review your accomplishments and lessons learned over the past year and use those insights to define goals and priorities for the coming year.

I've been doing annual reviews for more than 15 years. From that first slapdash list of 5 goals I wrote down on a Post-It note when I was 20 years old to the more thorough process I follow and lead people through today, I've learned a lot about how to do it right (as well as the pitfalls that tend to get people stuck). 

To maximize the depth and intensity of the experience, I concentrate all my goal-setting activities in a short period of time at the start of the year. That allows me to walk through each step of my CODE method – Capture, Organize, Distill, Express – in rapid succession so I can see patterns and connections far more easily.

I've found that it's impossible to just sit down and make a list of goals that will be meaningful throughout the entire year. Your goals have to emerge from a deep introspective process that includes different kinds of information, different ways of looking at your life, and different kinds of exercises.

The most powerful and authentic goals aren't rational – they emerge organically from your insights, lessons, realizations, mistakes, epiphanies, memories, disappointments, dreams, and so on. 

One of the best uses for a Second Brain – a personal system of knowledge management – is saving all those tidbits of insight so when January comes around, you have lots of rich material to work with. And if you haven’t done that already, don’t worry. You’ll be shocked how easy it is to “retroactively” capture the best ideas you’ve encountered over the past year.

If you want to follow my process for goal-setting, I have great news for you:

First, I want to share my [[Annual Review]] with you.

You can start right now and follow the same steps I take to review 2022 and craft your goals for 2023. 

Second, I want to invite you to set your goals together with me in Cohort 16 of Building a Second Brain. 

I will personally guide you through the process I’ve developed over many years, providing tips and pointers to move you forward while also helping you steer clear of the perfectionism, uncertainty, self-doubt, and procrastination that threaten to derail you. 

The “project” of completing your annual review will also serve as an opportunity to set up (or refurbish) your Second Brain system. 

There’s nothing I love more than killing two birds with one stone!

Cohort 16 starts on January 10th and will run for 3 weeks until February 1st. 

All you have to do is join the Building a Second Brain Membership (quarterly or annually) to participate.
