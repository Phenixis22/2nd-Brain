If you read the email I sent on day 2, you might remember me suggesting that you could literally get your phone out right now, find some natural lighting, and hit record on your first video. Because that really is all there is to it, as far as getting started goes 👊

But this might seem a bit _too_ easy. Just talk to your phone and upload onto YouTube? Surely it’s not that simple. Not everyone ends up with a massive channel. There must be some secret sauce to becoming a successful YouTuber 🤷‍♂️

And you’re absolutely right.

Getting your phone out and hitting record is great for getting started but there’s definitely more to ‘making it on YouTube’.

Today I want to take you through **the Top 5 things I think it takes to succeed**.

##  **🔁 1: Consistency**

This is perhaps the single, most non-negotiable, biggest determinant of your success on YouTube. And it’s not glamorous.

Pick a schedule and stick to it. _Religiously_. There’s so many reasons to do this.

Firstly, the YouTube algorithm favours consistent, regular creators. And you always want the algorithm on your side.

Secondly, you want someone to come to your channel and see a consistent backlog of content - if your last video is from 3 months ago and the one before that from 2018, it’s very very unlikely they’ll subscribe. I certainly wouldn’t, would you?!?

And thirdly, you want to establish an expectation, especially as you’re trying to grow. Commit to uploading on a set day each week and _stick to it_. People will start to get hyped for your weekly video.

If you post once on Wednesday and the next week on Friday and then on Sunday, people won’t know what to expect and will quickly switch off.

Before I hit 2 million subscribers, I was uploading 2-3 videos **every week** without fail. Things have changed a little now I’ve got an established audience and have started to expand the business, but I attribute a huge amount of my early growth to my consistency.

##  **🧘‍♂️ 2: Faith and Patience**

Let me break something to you (if you hadn’t worked it out already) - YouTube is not easy 😩](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f629/32.png)

This isn’t a get-rich-quick-scheme. For the huge majority of us, it’s a lot of work, for a long time, with absolutely no reward.

It took me 6 months and posting 53 videos to hit 1,000 subscribers. That is months of idea generating, editing, and churning out videos with little to no audience.

And the difference between those who make it and those who don’t is giving up in that painful period.

Be ready for zero views, zero engagement, zero subscribers. Expect the sound of crickets for months and months.

Set your expectations and be patient. It’s the only way to succeed 🚀

##  **💪 3: Hard Work**

Yep, it’s really no different to anything else. You have to put in the time, even when you don’t feel like it.

You’re guaranteed to find some parts harder than others: maybe you particularly dislike being on camera, or editing will take a while to learn, or you hate filming in public. But what’s absolutely certain is that you’ll improve in all these areas over time. And the skills and discipline they give you are amazing and transferrable.

##  **👀 4: Unfair Advantages**

These are really worth spending a bit of time thinking about.

What will make you stand out? ✋

What things are you fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have that you can focus on?

I was a medical student (‘hard’ to achieve), at Cambridge University (mysterious, prestigious). I had good camera gear and knew a thing or two about making things look pretty so my videos seemed well designed and stood out from other medics.

How can you stack the deck in your favour? ♠️

It might be having the money to buy the best gear out there and have sick production value from day one, or it might be your poor gut health prompting you to try different diets you can talk about.

We all have unfair advantages, it’s just a matter of realising what they are. (If you’re up for it, I talk about it more in [this](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75u2ex5vwps2uqvqdmfz/p8heh9h9r73kg0cr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1SR2JDUl9wcTRfQSZ0PTQycw==) video)

##  **🍀 5: Luck**

At the end of the day, growth and all numerical measures of success depend a great deal on luck.

And while you can’t really do much to increase your luck, you can definitely make sure that you stack the deck in your favour so when luck does come your way, you’re ready to seize the opportunity.

Posting regularly a couple of times a week will increase the chances that one of your videos will pop off. It’s like buying lottery tickets.

So you can’t literally produce luck but you can, to some extent, manufacture the conditions for luck to appear.
