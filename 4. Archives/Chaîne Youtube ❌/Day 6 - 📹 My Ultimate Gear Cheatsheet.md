When someone’s truly serious about YouTube, they quickly start asking me: _What camera should I buy? Do I need a ringlight? Where do you put your mic, I can never see it in your videos?_

Before I give you my Ultimate Notion page about Gear, I’ll summarise some key points here:

1. 🔁 Nothing is more important than **consistency** and putting out content in the first place.
2.  📱 You can just get started with your phone if you absolutely must. [Here’s a video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u87lpzg2swup3px8uv/g3hnh5hegzw442c3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dD0zcyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdj1Kd2hzUGROMlJOZw==) where I explain how.
3.   📸 You should consider upgrading your gear based on how seriously you want to take YouTube.
4.   🎙 The most important thing is audio. **People will sit through bad video quality but no one will sit through bad audio quality** - a microphone should be your first purchase.

With all that in mind, here’s the [**Ultimate Notion page**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u87lpzg2swup3px8uv/z2hr57k0inho5dxqqgiz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm90aW9uLnNvL1lvdVR1YmUtR2Vhci1mb3ItRGlmZmVyZW50LUJ1ZGdldHMtY2MwZGQ5OTJlOWQxNDhkMjk5ZjQ4OTg5ZDQ5MDAzY2E=) - enjoy!

There’s a lot of stuff in it, but if anything’s unclear please feel free to leave a comment on the page and I’ll try to address it.
