Sleep is the secret sauce.
There isn’t one facet of your mental, emotional, or physical performance that’s not affected by the quality of your sleep.

The consequences of sleep deprivation aren’t pretty either. Try immune system failure, diabetes, cancer, obesity, depression, and memory loss just to name a few.

A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal showed that sleep deprivation is directly related to an inability to lose weight.

Other studies show sleep deprivation encouraging cancer, Alzheimer’s, depression, and even heart disease. In a society that’s overworked and under-rested, it’s more important than ever to pay attention to issues associated with not getting the sleep that we require.

# Chapter 1 - know the value of sleep

what is sleep? And why is it important?

Sleep is actually defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.

most important takeaway is that it’s a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body. If you’re not doing it, then you’re being completely unnatural. And, nobody likes unnatural people.

being awake is catabolic (breaks you down) and sleep is anabolic (builds you up).

High quality sleep fortifies your immune system, balances your hormones, boosts your metabolism, increases physical energy, and improves the function of your brain. Without all of the essential benefits that sleep is providing, you will never, I repeat never, have the body and life you want without giving your body the right amount of sleep.

In our culture, sleep is not respected very much at all.

Research shows that after just 24 hours of sleep deprivation, there is an overall reduction of six percent in glucose reaching the brain. Simple translation: You get dumber.

The most valuable takeaway from this sleep deprivation “brain drain” discovery is that the reduction in glucose isn’t shared equally. Your parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex actually lose 12 to 14 percent of their glucose when you don’t sleep. These are the areas of the brain we most need for thinking, for distinguishing between ideas, for social control, and to be able to tell the difference between right and wrong.

Always remember the value of your sleep. You will perform better, make better decisions, and have a better body when you get the sleep you require. Sleep is not an obstacle we need to go around, it’s a natural state your body requires to boost your hormone function, heal your muscles, tissues and organs, and make your mind work at it’s optimal level.

You will factually work better, be more efficient, and get more stuff done when you’re properly rested.

A physician study published in The Lancet proved that sleep-deprived individuals took 14 percent longer to complete a task, and made 20 percent more errors than individuals who were well rested.

Structure your time to get more sleep first and you’ll be able to get your work done faster and more effectively

Sleep Power Tip

When you know you’ve got a big task, project, or event coming up, pull out a calendar and plan ahead how you can get your ideal number of sleep hours in.

Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”

getting more sunlight during the day

# Chapter 2 - get more sunlight during the day

science has proven that this is precisely the case.

Your circadian timing system is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a small group of nerve cells found in the hypothalamus in your brain. The hypothalamus is considered to be the master gland of your body’s hormonal system. It controls your body’s hunger, thirst, fatigue, body temperature, and sleep cycles by acting as a master clock.

sunlight exposure, triggers your body to produce optimal levels of daytime hormones and regulates your biological clock.

Too little light exposure during the day, and too much light exposure in the evening will negatively impact your ability to sleep well at night.

Mello Melatonin

Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland in your brain and it sends signals to create the best environment in your body for sleep. It’s secreted naturally as it gets darker outside, but we can really screw it up if we don’t get the right light exposure at the right time. Melatonin isn’t the “sleep hormone,” but it can definitely be considered the “get good sleep hormone.”

when you get more sunlight exposure during the day, and less light exposure at night, you’re on your way to a magic sleep formula that really works.

The office workers with more light exposure tended to be more physically active, happier, and had an overall higher quality of life.

Sunlight Power Tip #1

The body clock is most responsive to sunlight in the early morning, between 6 a.m. and 8:30 a.m.

Make it a habit to get some sun exposure in that primetime light period. Direct sunlight outdoors for at least one-half hour has been shown to produce the most benefit.

Sunlight Power Tip #2

use your break time to strategically go and get some sun on your skin.

Sunlight Power Tip #3

there are specially designed light boxes and visors that simulate sunlight.

This is likely the number one thing you can do to improve your sleep quality immediately.

# Chapter 3 - avoid the screens before bedtime

Computers, iPads, televisions, smartphones, etc., are kicking out a sleep-sucking blue spectrum of light that can give you major sleep problems.

our cultural use of these electronic devices has only been possible for the last few decades; first with the advent of television, and then really exploding with the advent of laptops, tablets, and smartphones in just the last 10 years. Millions of years of evolution versus 10 years of late-night meandering doesn’t favor our ability to adapt to this anytime soon.

We just need to have more awareness and more respect for our body’s natural processes.

## Screen Protection Power Tip #1

make it a mandate to turn off all screens at least 90 minutes before bedtime.

## Screen Protection Power Tip #2

Use an alternative medium for nighttime activity.

Remember those papery things called books? You can actually open one of those ancient relics and enjoy consuming a great story, inspiration, or education that way. And, remember when people actually talked to each other face-to-face? You can talk to the people in your life, listen to how their day went, find out what they’re excited about, and what they may be struggling with.

## Screen Protection Power Tip #3

Use a blue light blocker.

But, again, the best solution is to shut down the technology at least 90 minutes before bed, if you’re serious about getting great sleep. If that’s not feasible, this is a tool you can use that can definitely help you along the way.

Caffeine is a powerful nervous system stimulant.

# Chapter 4 - Have a caffeine curfew

We just have to <mark class="hltr-default">learn how to navigate our consumption of coffee and other caffeinated goodies to make sure that we’re still getting the best sleep possible</mark>.

Drinking a big cup of coffee on the way home from work can lead to negative effects on sleep, just as if someone were to consume caffeine closer to bedtime.

<mark class="hltr-default">having a cup of coffee or caffeinated tea even as much as six hours before bed can cause sleep troubles</mark>.

sleep disturbance was measured in two ways: objectively, by means of a sleep monitor used at home, and subjectively, from diaries kept by the participants.

The crazy part is that the participants didn’t note any subjective difference with their sleep in their sleep journal. Even though they physiologically lost sleep because of the caffeine, they didn’t consciously know it at first!

This is how the viscous cycle of sleep deprivation gets started. Not getting enough deep sleep due to caffeine consumption inevitably makes us more tired.
Being tired makes us want more caffeine. And, extra consumption of caffeine will, in-turn, make our sleep problems worse. We’ve got to have a strategy to break this viscous cycle to ensure that we’re getting the sleep our bodies deserve.

Living the Half-Life

Caffeine doesn’t “give you energy” in the way that most people believe. All day everyday while you’re awake, neurons in your brain are firing and producing a neurotransmitter byproduct known as adenosine. Please understand, adenosine is more than a simple waste product. Your nervous system is constantly monitoring for adenosine in your body, because once those levels raise to a certain point in your brain and spinal cord, your body starts to nudge you to go to sleep (or at least to relax).

Caffeine has the unique ability to fit into receptor sites in your body for adenosine, because it’s so structurally similar to the real thing. Normally, when your receptor sites are filled with real adenosine, your body shifts into rest mode. The issue with caffeine going into those receptors is that it simply sits there like a distant relative over-extending their stay on your couch. It doesn’t actually turn on functions, like adenosine would, to make you tired. As a result, your brain and body are still trucking along and you don’t realize that you’re actually sleepy. Pretty cool in some ways, but hopefully you can see where this could become a big problem.

Your body is still producing more and more adenosine

Due to this, you’re body literally has to change the way it normally functions, stress hormone levels increase in your system, and your brain and organs get overworked because they aren’t getting the accurate cues to rest and recover.

Caffeine has a half-life of around five to eight hours

This is why having caffeine even six hours out from bedtime still caused sleep disturbances in the study.

Smart Caffeine Power Tip #1

Set an unbreakable caffeine curfew to make sure your body has time to remove the majority of it from your system. For most people, it’s generally going to be before 2 p.m.

Smart Caffeine Power Tip #2

Caffeine can be used strategically to enhance fat loss, if used in the right way

That said, don’t throw the baby out with the bath water and negate the potential benefits of caffeine. To maximize your body’s use and benefit from caffeine, it has to be cycled.

1. Go on two days and three days off - If a healthy, non-addicted person is using caffeine, it can be cleared from your system nicely after three days. When you have it again, you’ll notice the same benefits as you did the initial days you used it.

2. Go two months on, one month off - This is reasonable if you’re using a small to moderate amount of caffeine daily (less than 200mg a day) as in a cup or two of black coffee or tea, or a pre-workout supplement. Using more caffeine than this can lead to withdrawal symptoms for the first few days after discontinued use

3. Go full on as needed - This is where the magical, “when we first met,” experience can happen with coffee and caffeine. On most days, ignore it; live your life normally, without caffeine, but when you need it, go full on into your love affair. Now when I say you “need it,” I’m talking about you have a performance, a big project, or something that is really important (but short in duration, so your indulgence won’t be more than a couple of days). Use caffeine as a boost, not a crutch, and you’ll be able to truly enjoy its benefits while still sleeping like a champion.

Something called thermoregulation heavily influences your body’s sleep cycles.

# Chapter 5 - be cool

When it’s time for your body to rest, there is an automatic drop in your core body temperature to help initiate sleep.

Studies have found that the ideal room temperature for sleep is really quite cool at around 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
Anything too far above or below this range will likely cause some difficulty sleeping.

To take this discovery even further, studies have shown that insomniacs (individuals with chronic sleep issues) tend to have a significantly warmer core body temperature than normal right before bed. This will inherently lead to a heightened state of arousal and struggle to fall asleep while their body tries to reset its internal thermostat.

To find your body’s internal thermostat, you have to go back to our understanding of the master gland, the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus actually integrates the function of your nervous system (what senses the internal and external temperature) and your endocrine system (what secretes specific hormones to either induce sleep or keep you awake). Your hypothalamus is like the coach of your cellular basketball team.

If the coach is treated well, given a nice salary of nutrition, and not over-stressed, chances are it can keep everyone in line, achieving the greatest results possible.

On the other hand, if the coach is under-paid, over-worked, lacks support, and miscommunicates the roles of the team, then the whole thing can fall apart fast.

This is why the health and support of your hypothalamus is so important.

Your hypothalamus is part of a very significant system in your body known as the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, or HPA-Axis for short.

The most important takeaway here is that the HPA-axis is your body’s number one system for managing stress.

The previously mentioned study on insomniacs also found that the test subjects experienced greater levels of anticipatory anxiety than normal test subjects. The worry and stress over sleeping was higher, and likely contributing to the increase in core body temperature. It’s not just the environment that needs to be cool, you need to be cool too (as in your mental and emotional state). Your HPA-axis is dealing with the overall stress load in your life. From work, to relationships, to nutrition, to your exercise, your HPA-axis is managing it all.

You absolutely must have a strategy to manage stress in our high-stressed world today, or you can sleep in an igloo and still not be cool enough.

Keep It Cool Power Tip #1

Make sure that the temperature in your bedroom stays close to the recommended 68 degrees Fahrenheit at night.

~20°

Get a nice, cool environment in your room and snuggle up to sleep more soundly.

Keep It Cool Power Tip #2

If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking a warm bath an hour and a half to two hours before hitting the sack. The increase in core temperature from the bath will fall accordingly and level out a little cooler right around the time you turn in for the night. Many parents know that this is the secret sauce for having young kids fall asleep and stay asleep at night.

Keep It Cool Power Tip #3

Even though the room temperature would ideally be cooler to induce great sleep, some people can trigger sleeplessness because their extremities are too cold. This is because blood flow is the primary method of distributing heat throughout the body. If your hands and feet are too cold, it could be a sign of poor circulation. The solution: wear a pair of warm socks to bed if you need to.

sleeping at the right hours

# Chapter 6 - go to bed at the right time

Timing your sleep is like timing an investment in the stock market—it doesn’t matter how much you invest, it matters when you invest

It’s been shown that human beings get the most beneficial hormonal secretions and recovery by sleeping during the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. This is what I call “Money Time.”

You get the most rejuvenating effects during this period, and any sleep that you get in addition is a bonus. This is based on the seemingly lost realization that we humans are a part of nature, and when the lights go out on the planet, that’s a cue from the universe that it’s time for us to turn down too.

By lining your sleep up with your natural hormonal secretions, the benefits you get from sleep will be exponentially better.

Melatonin, human growth hormone, and more are secreted in their strongest doses when your sleep is lined up properly. Want to stay young and vibrant longer? Then you need to know that you get the best dose of HGH, the “youth hormone,” if you’re sleeping during those prime time hours.

If your body is chronically deprived of the regenerative sleep between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., then you may still feel fatigued when you wake up in the morning

The Second Wind

Around 10 p.m., your body goes through a transformation following the natural rise in melatonin. This transformation is to increase internal metabolic energy to repair, strengthen, and rejuvenate your body.

If you’re asleep as normal during this phase, all is well. However, if you’re up when 10 p.m. rolls around that increase in metabolic energy can be experienced as a “second wind.”

It’s important to understand that your body’s ability to repair itself, remove free radicals, and maximize hormonal output, is greatly inhibited when you allow yourself to stay up and move into that second wind.

Money Time Power Tip #1

What you want to aim for to get the highest quality sleep possible is getting to bed within a few hours of it getting dark outside.

By doing this, you are giving yourself a huge hormonal advantage.

Nature is giving us direct cues on when to sleep, we just need to learn to pay attention to them.

Money Time Power Tip #2

To help reset your sleep cycle so that you’re actually tired when the optimal bedtime rolls around, make a habit of getting some sunlight as soon as possible when you wake up.

Money Time Power Tip #3

Even if you get a full night’s sleep, you can still wake up feeling groggy if your alarm goes off during the middle of one of your sleep cycles. To make your mornings better and more energetic, start setting your alarm so that it goes off in accordance with these sleep cycles instead of the standard “eight hours of sleep.”

if you ever do find yourself in a pinch and need to sleep less than normal. Shoot for getting that minimum of four sleep cycles in for a total of six hours.

Magnesium is a bonafide anti-stress mineral.

# Chapter 7 - Rub The "Anti-Stress" Mineral Into Your Skin Each Day

Magnesium is a bonafide anti-stress mineral. It helps to balance blood sugar, optimize circulation and blood pressure, relax tense muscles, reduce pain, and calm the nervous system. Yet, because it has so many functions, it tends to get depleted from our bodies rather fast.

Magnesium deficiency is likely the number one mineral deficiency in our world today.

A study published in The Journal of Intensive Care Medicine showed that people deficient in magnesium were twice as likely to die prematurely.

Magnesium levels can be a serious problem or a serious benefit depending where you are in the spectrum. This is definitely not something to take lightly.

research shows that one of the central symptoms of magnesium deficiency is chronic insomnia.
This is valuable information to know because simply getting your magnesium levels up can have a huge impact on your sleep quality very quickly.

Get It Up the Smart Way

Supplementation may not be the best method to get your magnesium levels up.
Research has shown that a large percentage of magnesium is lost in the digestive process.

Quality is everything when it comes to your magnesium sources. High quality supplementation can be helpful in small amounts, as well as a diet high in magnesium-rich foods. But, the most effective method of safely and effectively boosting your magnesium levels is through topical application onto your skin.

Anti-Stress Mineral Power Tip #1

Keep the Magnesium Infusion right by your bedside and apply it right before you hop into the covers. The best places to apply it are:
Anywhere that you are sore (hopefully you’re following my exercise advice, covered in # Chapter 11!).
In the center of your chest (a major “chakra” position aligned with your heart - one of the most magnesium dependent organs in your body).
Around your neck and shoulders (where many people carry a lot of their stress).
Spray it on liberally and massage it in. Four to six sprays per area is a great baseline to go with.

Anti-Stress Mineral Power Tip #2

Incorporate magnesium-rich foods in your diet too.

diet high in magnesium and low in aluminum was associated with deeper, uninterrupted sleep.

getting rejuvenating sleep is a high priority for you

The bedroom should be for two things primarily… 1) sleep and 2) we’ll get to in just a moment ;)

Stop making your bedroom the entertainment hub of your house. And, never bring work to bed with you.

Humans are creatures of habit and habitat.

If you create an environment where miscellaneous activities can take place in your sleep area, then you are not creating a neuro-association that it’s time to sleep when you go in there.

Bringing your office work into bed with you is one of the most offensive sleep crimes you can commit.

Cut the cord and don’t allow work to enter your sacred relaxation space.

Now, when you picture a sanctuary, what do you think of? Fresh air, flowing water, beautiful plants, and a serene environment may come to mind. The good news is that these are all things that you can recreate in your own private sleep sanctuary

Fresh air is very important. Did you know that the ions in the air you breathe can become “stale” and less energizing? The air you breathe carries more than just oxygen into your cells, it also carries other ionic elements that are vital for your health and well-being.

Upgrade Your Breathing Space

Negative ions are present in abundance near waterfalls, ocean surf, rivers, and mountains.

Negative ions impact our health in three significant ways:
1. They make the air more energizing by providing free electrons.
2. They oxidize odors, fungi, mold, parasites, and toxic chemical gases.
3. They bind to dust, pollen, cigarette smoke, and pet dander to form larger particles (which make them much easier to remove from your home).

Air ionizers are not just good for your sleeping space, they are good for your home in general. There are several air ionizers out there on the market, so do a bit of homework to make sure that the one you choose is the right fit for you.

At minimum, if you’re in a situation where fresh air can’t flow through your room via a window or fan during the winter months, try using a basic humidifier.

Studies show that both your heartbeat and breathing slow down after listening to running water. Obviously, I’m not talking about the drip from a leaky faucet, but the sound of running water can have an impressive effect on people who have a history of sleep problems.

Garden of Eden

One of the things synonymous with paradise is plant life. There are so many great benefits that you can get from having plants in your home that it’s just too much to ignore.

Take the English Ivy for example. NASA listed it as the number one air-filtering houseplant. It has an unmatched ability to absorb formaldehyde (a known neurotoxin), which most of us are exposed to in our highly industrialized world today. It’s incredibly easy to grow and it’s adaptable. You can have it as a hanging or a floor plant, and it requires moderate temperatures and medium sunlight.

Another great plant for your sleep sanctuary is the perennial Snake Plant. It doesn’t require much light or water to thrive. What’s most impressive about it is that it absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen during the night (while most plants do this during the day), so it’s the perfect plant to keep in your bedroom for an air quality boost.

Make your bedroom a sacred place where peace, calm, and relaxation are overflowing. When you walk into a sleep sanctuary, it’ll be easy to peacefully drift off to your dreams.

Sleep Sanctuary Power Tip #1

Get at least one houseplant to improve the air quality in your home and go from there. If you don’t have a green thumb and can barely take care of your own personal grooming (let alone a plant), then get a really low-maintenance plant, please. The pros of having a houseplant are simply too good to pass up; just make sure that it’s something that suits you and not an additional stressor. If you don’t have a good resource for houseplants, simply check out Amazon.com for many of the most popular varieties.

Sleep Sanctuary Power Tip #2

If you share a sleeping space with someone else, make an agreement with them to keep office work out of the bedroom. This is a sacred space for the both of you, and usually it just takes a heart-to-heart conversation to make sure that everyone is on the same page. The biggest person to hold to the agreement is yourself, so have the discipline to keep your bed reserved for sleep

Having an orgasm can be like a full-on sedative for most people.

# Chapter 9 - have a big ''o''

Research shows that during orgasm, both women and men release a cocktail of chemicals, including norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin, and the pituitary hormone prolactin.

Oxytocin, for example, triggers a cascade of bodily events including the release of other feel-good hormones called endorphins. This rush of endorphins and relaxing hormones when you release can be just the thing to set you up for a great night’s sleep.

It’s well established that a big component of insomnia is stress. If you’re really stressed out, it can make it more difficult to fall asleep. Well, in the year 2000, a study was conducted with 2,632 women and found that 39 percent of those who masturbate reported that they do it in order to relax. Serotonin and oxytocin released during orgasm are two built-in, natural stress reducers.

Studies clearly demonstrate that plasma prolactin concentrations are substantially increased for over an hour following orgasm for both men and women. With that said, we can finally understand why sex is sometimes referred to as “sleeping” with someone.

Our ability to have and give orgasms is tightly linked to our health and well-being.

the brain is actually the largest sex organ because of the vital role it plays in sexual arousal (whoever said size doesn’t matter?). Cultivating your brain-body connection is critical to a fulfilling sex life and getting the best sleep ever.

The Big “O” Power Tip #1

communication is key in this area. Everyone is different, and what satisfies one person might not do a thing for another. Find out what your lover likes and find out what you like. Share this info with them because being a clairvoyant is not on most of our résumés. Share with your partner what turns you on, and what takes you over the top. I promise you that this data will be valuable to you both.

The Big “O” Power Tip #2

An obvious aspect of sex’s impact on sleep is the physical exertion involved. When you put in some work bumpin’ and grindin’, you’ll naturally feel more fatigued after the session is over.
You don’t have to just lay there most of the time all vanilla-ice-cream style. Move around, get involved, and put your back into it. Lying back and receiving is super fine as well, but if you want to earn your sleep black belt then you’ve got to put some work in too.

we sleep better in a dark environment

# Chapter 10 - Get it blacked out

Having light sources of any type in your bedroom can disrupt your sleep patterns. And, even using an eye mask is not going to be 100 percent effective for most people.

skin actually has receptors that can pick up light

These photoreceptors are similar to those found in your retina, so your skin can literally see.

If there’s light in your bedroom, your body is picking it up and sending messages to your brain and organs that can interfere with your sleep.

Humans

evolved to adjust to predictable light and dark phases to set their circadian clocks.

Today, the average person’s sleep has decreased from around nine hours to about seven, and it hasn’t been a pretty transition either.

Studies show that exposure to room light during usual hours of sleep suppresses melatonin levels by more than 50 percent. That’s not good!

Melatonin has been proven to:
Improve immune system function Normalize blood pressure Reduce the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth (including leukemia) Enhance DNA protection and free radical scavenging Decrease risk of osteoporosis Decrease risk of plaques in the brain (like those seen with Alzheimer’s disease) Alleviate migraines and other pain Improve thyroid function Improve insulin sensitivity and weight reduction

Not getting enough sleep, and not sleeping in darkness, will age you faster and suck away your vitality.

Night Light Fight

Sleep experts suggest that your room be so dark that you can’t see your hand in front of your face.

researchers from the Scheie Eye Institute at Pennsylvania University discovered that even a simple nightlight could cause myopia in children and lead to significant vision problems later in life.

This isn’t just important for us, as adults, it’s also important if you have children and grandchildren as well.

Take action to turn your bedroom into a nice, cozy sleep cave. Personally, this is the one thing that instantly had a beneficial impact on my sleep. I blacked out my bedroom and have been getting the best sleep of my life ever since.

Get It Blacked Out Power Tip #1

You don’t just want to block out the light from outside, you want to eliminate the troublesome light inside your bedroom too.

You can start by simply covering the alarm clock up as one tactic.

Get It Blacked Out Power Tip #2

Once you have your blackout curtains, you may find that there is still some light that sneaks in over the top. You can simply roll up a blanket or towel to cover up that area.

Getting rid of the light pollution in your bedroom is a huge key to getting the most peaceful and rejuvenating sleep possible.

Exercise

# Chapter 11 - Train hard (but smart)

The research shows that you can stay younger, longer if you have more lean muscle on your body.

The secret is that your body transforms from your workout while you’re asleep.
This is when your body releases all of the beneficial hormones and elicits repair programs to build you up better than before. You just exposed yourself to a significant healthy stressor with a workout, but you only get the reward if you properly rest and recover.

Exercise can be amazing for you. As a matter of fact, it’s essential to being the healthiest version of yourself. You get so many positive benefits from improving insulin sensitivity, to boosting healthy hormone function, to enhancing your metabolism.

It’s not so much the exercise itself, but the when and how the exercise is done. To optimize your sleep (and thus, optimize your results from exercise) you’ve got to utilize a few principles when it comes to working out.

Night Time is Not the Right Time

A recent study at Appalachian State University found that morning workouts are ideal if you want to get the best sleep at night.

the morning exercisers had up to 75 percent more time in the reparative “deep sleep” stage at night.

One of the big issues with working out late in the evening is that it significantly raises your core body temperature, and it can take upwards of five to six hours for it to come down again.

If you had to pick a time, morning is the best when it comes to sleep, early evening can provide some benefit (if you time things right), and smack-dab in the afternoon showed little to no benefit at all. Exercise and movement is important no matter when you do it, but we have natural hormonal cycles that we need to honor if we’re going to get the most from it.

the previous chart

Page 68

we have a big spike of cortisol in the early morning that is for the sole purpose of us doing activity. It gradually drops during the day and bottoms out when it’s our natural time to get to sleep.

Take full advantage of this knowledge and structure your life in a way that you exercise at the best time to have the body and health you deserve.

we are not just products of our environment; we are creators of our environment!

Insane in the Membrane

Conventional moderate pace jogging is the mother of all long-duration catabolic exercise. You’re keeping your sympathetic nervous system firing continuously for the 30 minutes or so that you’re jogging, plus all of the stress hormones you secrete don’t get a chance to be broken down and eliminated—they build up in your body like a balloon being filled with too much water.

been mislead to believe that “cardio” in the form of jogging for long time periods is the ideal way to lose fat. The reality is that nothing could be further from the truth. Running for long distances can radically increase muscle loss through a process called gluconeogenesis. Muscle is your body’s fat-burning machinery, and if you lose it by running too much, you will depress your metabolism and find that if you don’t keep running you’ll start getting fat very quickly.

you should do long distance running only if you truly love it.

be aware and be smart about it, and make sure that you do some of the other stuff you’re about to learn.

Quality over Quantity

Most men have no issues with this, but many women still have the idea that lifting heavy weights will make them “bulky.” The reality is that most men who lift weights like crazy struggle to put on size

As a matter of fact, if you lose weight through the traditional way of dieting and cardio, you’ll simply be able to go from an apple shape to a smaller apple shape.
By lifting weights you can actually change your body’s composition, and potentially go from an apple shape to an hourglass shape. Lifting weights enables you to express your true genetic potential. Your genes expect you to lift heavy things, and when you do that your body changes accordingly.

Train Smart Power Tip #1

Take out a schedule and block off specific appointment times for you to workout using the info above. You can set a time for the morning or evening, just ensure that you’re giving yourself the best advantage for getting great sleep. If you’re really serious about being the healthiest person you can be, you’ll set your personal exercise appointment time first, and then schedule everything else around it.

Train Smart Power Tip #2

Make sure that you’re lifting weights at least two days per week. Focus on compound lifts like back squats, deadlifts, dumbbell presses, overhead presses, rows, and pull-downs.

Cell phones, televisions, desktops, laptops, iPads, Kindles, tablets, and more.

# Chapter 12 - Get your "friends" out of your room

A study sponsored by mobile companies themselves found that using cell phones before bed caused people to take longer to reach critical deep stages of sleep and they spent less time in deep sleep.

The most alarming part is that at least 50 percent of Americans sleep with their cell phones right by their side. Many people will admit to checking message alerts in the middle of the night (and needlessly disrupting their sleep patterns). Plus, many more will admit that the first thing they do is reach for their cell phone as soon as they wake up each day.

how you begin and end your day has a huge impact on the results in your life.

Starting the day checking emails and messages on your phone immediately puts others priorities ahead of yours.

You are, in essence, saying, “I know I have things that I want to accomplish, but I would much rather try to take care of them last when I’m stressed out, out of time, and out of energy.”

Ending your day by kissing your cell phone goodnight and laying it by your side is another surefire way to set yourself up for failure.

the spectrum of light emitted from your cell phone screen triggers your brain to secrete more “daytime hormones” which delays and reduces the secretion of the sleepy time hormone melatonin.

Cooking Up Cancer

Our appliances and electronic devices emit both electric and magnetic fields known as EMFs. Electric fields are easily blocked by walls and other objects, but magnetic fields can pass through walls, buildings, and the human body with ease. EMFs have been found to cause disruption in communication between the cells in our bodies.

If the wrong information is communicated amongst the upwards of 100 trillion cells you have, autoimmune diseases can manifest, hormones can be thrown out-of-whack, and even cancer cells can show their ugly faces.

The World Health Organization has now classified cell phone radiation as a Class B carcinogen.

cell phones were identified as a contributor to salivary gland tumors. The report states that your risk of getting a parotid tumor on the same side of your head that you use for listening to the cell phone increases by:
34 percent if you are a regular cell phone user and have used a mobile phone for five years.
58 percent if you had more than about 5,500 calls in your lifetime.
49 percent if you have spoken on the phone for more than 266.3 hours during your lifetime.

The results on children are far worse.

their thinner skull bones allow for greater penetration of cell phone radiation.

The radiation can deeply impact tissues all the way to their midbrain, where tumors are more fatal. Additionally, children’s cells reproduce faster, so they’re more susceptible to aggressive cell growth.

Don’t keep cell phones around your body needlessly, and communicate this to the young people in your life as well.

Get the electronics out of your bedroom!

Couples who keep a TV in their bedroom have sex half as often as those who don’t

Having these electronics in your bedroom is like a first-degree assault on your sleep. Take action on this now, out of respect for your body, and get those gadgets out of your bedroom.

Friends Out Power Tip #1

use an alternative alarm clock. You can use the alarm clock I recommended in # Chapter 10, with the full shut-off dimmer, you can use a traditional buzzer alarm clock, or you can even use a rooster for all I care. Just stop using your cell phone if you don’t have to.

Friends Out Power Tip #2

the reality of the situation is that communication is the basis for any successful union. If you want to get the TV out of your bedroom and you are worried that your partner won’t want to go along with it, simply have a compassionate heart-to-heart with them.
Explain why this is important to you, and ask them if they’d be willing to work with you on this because you respect them and want them to be happy as well. You’ll probably be surprised what a little extra love and communication can do (plus give them a copy of this book as a backup).

Friends Out Power Tip #3

will be okay if you keep your phone in another room while you sleep. It’s 99.999 percent likely that you won’t miss anything important. But, you will radically improve your sleep quality if you’re not allowing your cell phone’s notifications and radiation to disrupt your valuable sleep.

One of the most overlooked problems with getting great sleep is having too much body fat on your frame.

# Chapter 13 - Lose weight and don't find it again ?

Being overweight causes severe stress to your internal organs, your nervous system, and disrupts your endocrine system like few things can.

Your endocrine system (aka your body’s hormonal system) is responsible for producing hormones like melatonin, serotonin, and cortisol that we’ve talked about in relation to sleep.

Research presented by Deakin University in Australia showed that after consuming a meal, overweight individuals secreted radically higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

These high cortisol levels translate to higher blood sugar, lower insulin sensitivity, and increased levels of inflammation.

Having higher levels of these stress hormones in your body will inherently damage normal function, no matter what time of day the meal is eaten.

One of the more obvious issues that being overweight can have on sleep quality is sleep apnea.

The term sleep apnea refers to a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or infrequent breathing during sleep.

As the person gains weight, especially in the trunk and neck area, the risk of sleep-disordered breathing increases due to compromised respiratory function.

When we talk about weight loss, we’re talking about an issue that plagues millions of people worldwide each year. Good people, smart people, truly determined people, it doesn’t matter. If you give a determined person the wrong map, they will inherently end up at the wrong destination.

The Low Down

The first thing to understand is that you are either burning fat or storing fat...
there is no in between

If you’re activating hormones that store fat all the time, then you’re automatically throwing yourself out of the game

Your body’s major fat-storing hormone is insulin.

it’s one of the most important hormones to your survival

The number one thing that insulin reacts to is carbohydrates. This includes all starches like bread, pasta, and potatoes, refined sugar products like cakes, candy, and soda, and even healthier carbohydrates like fresh fruit.

To shift your body into more of a fat-burning state, you need to put more of your focus on the other two macronutrient groups: protein and fat. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition showed that increasing protein intake led to enhanced weight loss and improved blood fat levels. And a study in the New England Journal of Medicine split 132 people (many of which had metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes) into either a low-carb group or a low-dietary fat group for six months. The low-carb group lost an average of 12.8 lbs while the low-fat group lost only 4.2 lbs. The lower-carb, higher dietary fat group literally lost three times as much weight!

It’s not about having a low-carb diet necessarily; it’s about having a better ratio of all three macronutrient groups for you and your unique metabolism.

By eating a higher ratio of protein and healthy fats you’ll enable your pancreas to produce more glucagon instead of insulin. Glucagon triggers the breakdown of stored fatty acids for fuel, and is essential to utilize if fat loss is your goal.

The Micronutrient Secret

Micronutrients are things like the vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, phytonutrients, and enzymes that all enable our body to function at its highest level.

micronutrients are essential to achieving healthy hormone function, and remember, fat loss is all about the hormones! Eating micronutrient-rich foods can trigger your body to secrete more leptin (the satiety hormone) to keep you balanced, healthy, and in control.

Where do you get all of these micronutrient rich foods?
Easy: Just eat real food!

Here’s a simple list of things to help you know if it’s a real food or not:
If you can’t tell where it comes from, chances are it’s not real food (i.e. a bagel doesn’t have any resemblance to a strand of wheat).
If it comes through a drive though window, chances are it’s not real food.
If there are more than four or five ingredients, chances are it’s not real food.
If it even has to list the ingredients on it, chances are it’s not real food.
If it has a mascot or a special toy for buying it, chances are it’s not real food.

to get the body you want to have, you have to get reconnected to nature again. Your genes literally expect you to eat certain things. Once you get yourself reprogrammed through real food and smart exercise, there’s literally no limit to how good things can get.

I Know You Are, But What Am I?

Being overweight or obese is a double-edged sword. Not only does obesity contribute to sleep problems, but sleep problems can also contribute to obesity.

when you’re tired or sleep deprived, this is the hardest time to resist the junk food that you know you should be avoiding.
When you’re physically and mentally tired, your brain is looking for extra calories to keep everything functioning at a baseline level.

Researchers discovered that sleep deprivation reduced the “higher order” functions of the brain, and created excessive response in the primitive parts of the brain. Brain imaging scans done at UC Berkley showed that sleep deprivation caused more brain activity in the amygdala, an area associated with motivation to eat. The amygdala is very much a more emotional, reactive, survival-based part of the brain. Study participants that these scans were taken from did, in fact, make poorer choices in food.

it isn’t always about our willpower. So many really amazing and strong people fail at weight loss because they’ve unknowingly stacked conditions against themselves. By being sleep deprived, your inner incredible hulk highjacks your brain and you can’t resist doing the very activity that you promised yourself not to do.

now that you know these critical insights to changing your body, you’ve got to consciously stack the conditions in your favor to make future failures impossible.

sleep deprivation decreases your insulin sensitivity, disrupts your hormonal cycles, and depressed your brain function, we know that her statement is 100 percent true.

Lose Weight While Sleeping Power Tip #1

If you really have to have something closer to bedtime, have a high-fat, low-carb snack. This will ensure that your blood sugar stays stable.

If you want to get truly restful sleep, one of the worst things you can do is eat right before bed

Give your body a solid 90 minutes (more is better) before heading off to bed after eating. Again, this is especially true if you’re eating carbs, because if you’re asleep when hypoglycemia hits, it will likely wake you up and give you difficulties falling back asleep.

Lose Weight While Sleeping Power Tip #2

Have your first meal be an epic one. Start your day off smart. Most people in our modern world have been programmed to start their day by having dessert for breakfast. Oatmeal, toast, pancakes, bagels, cereals, fruit smoothies, and more. You’re starting your day with a huge insulin spike and setting yourself up for a day of fat-storage because of this.

Here we have one of the biggest secrets to long-term fat loss: keep insulin down through the first part of your day.

If you want to lose fat, redefine your definition of a healthy breakfast, and start your body off in a fat-burning state, instead of a fat-storing state.

Did you know that you actually get smarter while you sleep?

# Chapter 14 - Go easy on the bottle

One of the most valuable, and overlooked aspects of sleep, is an operation called memory processing. This is where short-term memories and experiences get converted into long-term memories.

Memory processing is predominantly affected by different stages of REM sleep.

REM sleep is significantly disrupted by alcohol being in your system.

Additionally, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis found that participants who had disrupted sleep cycles were more likely to show Alzheimer’s disease-related signs than sound sleepers.

not mistake sleep quantity for sleep quality

Ladies’ Night

There’s strong evidence that drinking late in the evening is even more problematic for women. A study published in 2011 had people drink alcohol in the name of science.

The findings showed that female participants woke up more often during the night, stayed awake longer, and slept for less time overall, than the men.

It’s possible that alcohol affects women’s sleep more because women metabolize alcohol faster than men.

Drinking late at night affects everyone in some way, it’s just about being able to navigate this to get the sleep we really need.

I Gotta Go

One of the more obvious sleep interruptions from drinking alcohol before bed is the uncanny need to urinate.

Every time you wake up from an alcohol-influenced sleep, it can be more difficult to fall back into the deep sleep stages you need to recover.

Drinking close to bedtime can also exacerbate current health problems that someone is dealing with.

alcohol decreases muscle tone in the upper airway, meaning that breathing-related sleep issues are exacerbated after you’ve had a couple of drinks.

the real solution is to get the excess weight off of your frame to reverse the sleep apnea and improve your sleep quality.

you’ve got to get your priorities in order, and take care of the things that are most important, so that you can enjoy your time with your friends and family even more.

Drinking Smart Power Tip #1

Wrap it up at least four hours before hitting the sack.

The amount you drink, your weight, and your body fat will play a role in exactly how long that is.

Drinking Smart Power Tip #2

Drink more... water, that is.

To help nullify the effects of the alcohol faster, you need to drink more water to help flush out the metabolic waste products left behind.

Alcohol is also a diuretic, meaning it will cause your body to expel more fluids and increase your likelihood of dehydration. For every alcoholic drink you have, your body can eliminate up to four times as much liquid. Dehydration is one of the primary causes of nausea and other non-appealing symptoms of a hangover.

sleeping positions

# Chapter 15 - Play your position

We tend to not think about the importance of our sleeping position because it’s something that we’ve done for so long that it’s become automatic.
The reality is that your sleeping position matters. A lot.

Here are just some of the things that are affected by your sleeping position:
Blood flow to your brain Stability of your spine Hormone production Joint and ligament integrity Oxygen supply and efficient breathing Muscular function and healing Heart function and blood pressure Digestion and cellular metabolism

If you’re sleeping in a position that compromises your body’s ability to function and recover,

you’re still going to feel like a piñata the day after the party when you wake up.

One of the most important facets of your sleeping position is maintaining the integrity of your spine.

your spine is directly connected to every major organ in your body.

If your spine is compromised and there’s a break in the information between your brain and your body, chronic and catastrophic problems can take place.

sleeping on your back is the ideal position to be in.

your spine can be in the best position here

You will also have less likelihood of digestive distress, like acid reflux, in this position.

sleeping on your back allows your facial skin to breathe and you’ll be less prone to having breakouts and early-onset wrinkling.

The downside of sleeping on your back is the greater likelihood of snoring and sleep apnea.

Back-sleeping is the most politically correct choice but, admittedly, not the most comfy position to be in

but not the best position if you’re making these big mistakes:

Using a huge pillow

Having a pillow (or pillows) that are too big under your head while lying on your back, totally misaligns the natural curve of your spine. You can end up with neck pain, back pain, headaches, or even worse. There’s also poor circulation to your brain all night because the blood is trying to move uphill past Mount Pillow.

During sleep, you’d naturally have your head lower, because this is the one time that your body shouldn’t have to work harder to pump blood to your brain.

Using a worn out mattress

The mattress is supposed to support you. Not too much (like the floor) and not too little (like having your butt sink into a fluffy abyss).

make sure that you’re not sinking in so much that your spine’s natural curve is compromised.

Sleep Like a Baby

Child development specialist Dr. Václav Vojta states that lying on our stomach as infants is actually critical to our development.

there are specific pressure points on our bodies that “activate” nervous system programs when we are infants. These pressure points are engaged when children are allowed to lie on their bellies and do subtle movements that we would naturally do while sleeping.

Lying down face-first with your legs straight and your arms right by your side is probably a bad idea. This is compromising your back by taking away the natural curve of your lumber spine. Add having your head to one side, smashed into a pillow for hours on end, and you’ve got a serious recipe for disaster.

some research shows that lying on your stomach can help prevent snoring and some symptoms of sleep apnea.

Lift a knee: Lift one knee up to open your hips and take some of the pressure off your spine from laying with your legs straight.

Lose the pillow: If you’re going to sleep on your belly, then ditch the pillow, because you really don’t need it.

Use the pillow for something else: Placing a small, firm pillow underneath your belly and hips will reduce the stress on your low back and neck. Simply place a pillow in a comfortable spot on the same side that you’ve lifted your leg and you’re in a much healthier position to sleep on your stomach.

On the Winning Side

Our most intense times of sleep and development happened while we were in the womb, curled up in the fetal position. Sleeping on our side is the natural sleeping position to emulate this developmental template.

Side sleeping can be a quick fix for snoring and help to improve breathing, more so than lying on your back. Sleeping on your side (the left side in particular) has been reported to ease troublesome digestive problems like acid reflux and heartburn.

The downside, as most side-sleepers know, is the dreaded “dead-arm” and finger numbness from this position. Sleeping on your arm for too long can cut off blood flow and nerve function.

Here are some simple tips for sleeping on your side:

Shoulder lean: Instead of sleeping with your shoulder directly under you, move it forward slightly to avoid constriction of your shoulder and arm muscles.

Pillow proposition: Make sure that your head isn’t propped up too high on pillows. You want to ensure that you’re maintaining the natural straight position of your spine with a pillow that supports your neck, but doesn’t raise your head too much.

For those with back pain: Experts recommend sleeping on your side with a soft pillow between your knees if you have a history of back problems. This helps to stabilize your spine and alleviate pressure from your hips and lower back.

Are You Sleeping with Your Soul Mate, or Sleeping with the Enemy?

If you want to keep them as your favorite person, and continue to be theirs, you’ve got to navigate this sleep situation with intelligence.

The relationship goes to a whole new level when you meet somebody’s sleep alter ego.

communicating and following the guidance in this book is going to be invaluable.

Play Your Position Power Tip #1

Our sleep position habits are just like any other habits: they can take some time to change. Start off the night in your ideal sleep position, and if you wake up during the night and find yourself in a position that you don’t want to be in, simply make a conscious effort to get into one that you prefer.

Play Your Position Power Tip #2

Make sure to communicate your sleeping needs and preferences with your partner—this simply cannot be emphasized enough. Talk to them with intention and compassion. Understand their sleeping needs, and make sure that you’re doing what you can to make them feel comfortable too.

There is a great quote that says, “My bed is a magical place where I suddenly remember everything I was supposed to do.”

# Chapter 16 - Calm your inner chatter

We need to learn to turn the volume down when we want to.
And, it’s really as simple as that.

it’s important to have a practice to help you buffer that stress. That important practice is meditation.

Meditation is like a tonic. A tonic is something that you can use everyday, and the results continue to get better and better. The more you meditate, the more calm and presence you’ll have in your day-to-day life.

I’m talking about frequency

the effects are cumulative

Performance

researchers discovered that people trained to meditate over an eight-week period were better able to control specific type of brain waves called “alpha rhythms.”

Christopher Moore, stated, “These activity patterns are thought to minimize distractions, to diminish the likelihood stimuli will grab your attention. Our data indicate that meditation training makes you better at focusing, in part by allowing you to better regulate how things that arise will impact you.”

ability to focus and get things done is a huge component of overall success.

Meditation literally changes your brain and enables you to utilize your ability to focus like nothing else can.

There is an absurd amount of data mounting about the beneficial impact of mediation on work performance, productivity, memory, and focus.

Health

Research at the Medical College of Georgia found that meditation lowered blood pressure and reduced the risk of heart disease and stroke. Numerous studies also demonstrate that meditation can reduce chronic pain and associated inflammatory biomarkers.

Countless studies show the stress-reducing effects in healthy individuals, as well as in patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Meditation has proven to be good for your brain, good for your body, and good for life overall.

Sleep

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine published research showing that meditation is an effective treatment for insomnia. The study showed that over a two-month period sleep latency, total sleep time, total wake time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and depression improved in patients who used meditation.

Results of the study show that teaching deep relaxation techniques during the daytime can help improve sleep at night.

The most important takeaway is that the only side effects associated with meditation are a better quality of life.

Ride the Wave

We all have four different brain wave frequencies that are most often expressed, measured in cycles per second (Hz). Each of these brain wave frequencies have their own set of characteristics that demonstrate specific brain activity and a unique state of consciousness.

Beta waves (15-40 Hz): This is the brain rhythm in the normal state of wakefulness, associated with thinking, conscious problems solving, and attention towards the outer world.

Alpha waves (9-14 Hz): When you are truly relaxed, your brain waves slow from the hyper-alertness of beta waves to the gentle waves of alpha. The “alpha state” is where meditation begins and it’s a brain wave frequency that heightens your imagination, visualization, memory, learning, and concentration.

Theta waves (4-8 Hz): Theta brain waves are present during deep meditation and light sleep, including the important REM dream state. This is the domain of your subconscious and only experienced momentarily as you drift off to sleep from alpha or wake from deep sleep (delta waves). We are more receptive to insights and information beyond our normal conscious awareness in this state. Some experts state that theta meditation amplifies intuition and other extrasensory perception skills.

Delta waves (1-3 Hz): The delta frequency is the slowest of the frequencies and is experienced in deep, dreamless sleep. It is also seen occasionally in very experienced meditators. The delta state is critical to the body’s healing processes. Most regeneration and healing happen in this brain-wave state, making getting enough deep sleep critical to our survival.

The ability to change your brain waves is why meditation works.

Primetime

One of the best times for meditation is when you’re already close to the alpha and theta brain waves. This would be as soon as you wake up in the morning, or right before bed at night.

this is a healthy habit you can create to benefit your life in numerous areas. As little as five to ten minutes to start your day will have a cumulative effect on your energy, focus, and ability to sleep better at night.

If you ever find yourself in a situation where you wake up too soon and have trouble going back to sleep, simply lay in your bed and practice a breathing meditation to put your brain into the alpha and/or theta state to mimic some of the benefits of the sleep you would normally be missing out on.

Calm It Down Power Tip #1

If you decide to meditate at night to help you wind-down for sleep, try doing it before you get into the bed, not while you’re in bed.

Calm It Down Power Tip #2

Use guided meditations to help you get acclimated when you’re first starting out. They can be really helpful for extremely busy-minded people because your attention goes to the instructions along the way.

Calm It Down Power Tip #3

If you do want to use a simple meditation/mindfulness practice to help you fall asleep while lying in bed, try this:
Lay peacefully on your back with a comfortable pillow to support your head if you need one.
Take a deep breath, breathing in for five seconds, holding for five seconds, then breathing out for five seconds, and holding out for five seconds. Do this sequence three times.
Now shift your focus to breathing and circulating that oxygen to your toes. Visualize the air coming in through your nose then traveling down to your toes, and then back out (following the same breathing count above).
Next, move your attention to your feet. Breathe in through your nose and circulate the air to your feet following the same breathing count above (five seconds in, five seconds hold, five seconds out, five seconds hold).
Next, move your attention to your ankles, then your shins, then your knees, then your thighs, going all the way up your body until you gently drift away. Many people fall asleep before reaching their knees. You’ve got to experiment and find out what works best for you. Give this one a try anytime you like.

you need to address the lifestyle issues first that are actually causing the sleep problem.

# Chapter 17 - Use smart supplementation

If you jump to taking drugs or supplements then you’ll just be treating a symptom and increase the likelihood that you’ll develop a dependency on something that can harm you long term.

Focus on the lifestyle stuff first, and if you want, you can respectfully add these things in too.

Chamomile: This herb has been used for thousands of years to treat everything from skin disorders, to heart disease, to inflammation. Today numerous studies are proving the true efficacy of this ancient plant.

There’s currently much more anecdotal evidence of chamomile being a safe sleep aid than peer reviewed studies. What studies do show is that chamomile can help calm the nervous system, relax muscles, and set you up for a better night’s sleep when you need it.
Chamomile is an excellent tea to have before bed. Simply have a standard size cup of tea with an organic, pre-packed chamomile tea bag and you’ll be good to go.

Kava kava: This is actually the national drink of the beautiful island of Fiji.
Kava kava is well known to have sedative properties and is commonly used to treat sleeplessness and fatigue. A 2004 study also found that 300mg of kava kava may improve mood and cognitive performance. Several additional studies show that it’s effective for reducing the signs and symptoms of anxiety

Valerian: This traditional herb is the strongest of the three and a moderate sedative. It’s indicated for individuals that have a difficult time falling asleep and also promotes uninterrupted sleep. The root of the valerian plant is used as medicine and pressed into fresh juice or freeze-dried to form a powder. For tea, pour one cup of boiling water over one teaspoon (two to three grams) of dried root, and steep five to ten minutes. There are also tinctures and dried powder supplement capsules of this and the previous two medicinal herbs.

5-HTP, GABA, and L-Tryptophan: I bundled all three of these together because they are not the ideal choices, due to the fact that they’re not natural herbal preparations like the previous three. These are isolated chemicals, and can be helpful if intently monitored and used with caution.

5-HTP is a neurotransmitter precursor to serotonin. In our bodies, serotonin is converted into melatonin (the get good sleep hormone). In one study, people who took 5-HTP went to sleep quicker and slept more deeply than those who took a placebo. Researchers recommend 200-400mg at night to stimulate serotonin, but it may take six to twelve weeks to be fully effective.

GABA is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In fact, it is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Therefore, it blocks the action of excitatory brain chemicals. Some people swear by the sedating effects of GABA to help manage stress. If GABA is of interest to you, 500mg in the evening is a good place to start. Also, consider looking into the GABA precursors picamilon and phenibut.

L-Tryptophan is actually the precursor to 5-HTP. Although you can’t get 5-HTP in food, there are several foods that are rich in tryptophan like turkey, chicken, pumpkin, sunflower seeds, collard greens, and sea veggies.
Although these foods can be part of a healthy diet, the trace amounts found in them may not be enough to get the effects you’re looking for. L-tryptophan is a simple, over-the-counter supplement you can use in addition to what you get from your diet. It can be taken 90 minutes before bed.

These, like all other supplements, will influence people differently.

You’ve got to experiment to find out what works best for you with intelligence, safety, and the best results long-term.

The Melatonin Mistake

Many experts agree that melatonin supplementation can be very effective for some people.

it is an actual hormone you’re taking. And just like any other hormone therapy, like testosterone therapy or estrogen therapy, it comes with a greater risk of side effects and potential problems.

it can potentially down-regulate your body’s natural ability to produce melatonin on its own.
Again, this is an actual hormone supplement, so unless you want to chance creating a dependency on this, I’d say avoid it and try other things first.

Supplementation Power Tip #1

It can’t be stressed enough that all the other strategies in this book are recommended before supplementation. In nature, you would not see compounds like these anywhere. They typically only have a few decades of testing (if that) versus the thousands upon thousands of years that homo sapiens have been on the planet.

There are some brilliant scientists and innovators making progress in supplementation and medicine that can be lifesaving, but please, never mistake a product in a capsule for being real food.

Supplementation Power Tip #2

Find the right dose for yourself.

The best advice is to start low and work your way up, unless you are 100 percent certain in what you are doing.

Supplementation Power Tip #3

Don’t mix sleep aids with alcohol. By mixing the two together, you can relax muscles too much, stop breathing, and find yourself waking up like Bruce Willis in The 6th Sense (Spoiler alert: he was dead and didn’t know it).

waking up in the early part of the day that sets the template for a great night’s sleep.

# Chapter 18 - Be early to rise

Going to sleep early and waking early syncs the body clock with the earth’s natural circadian rhythms, which is more restorative than trying to sleep while the sun’s up.

humans have certain patterns of sleep and wakefulness

humans are not nocturnal creatures

Our eyesight sucks in the darkness.

We don’t have a very strong sense of smell either.

We can’t hear well enough to navigate the darkness either.

Humans have amazing senses that are really accentuated during the day.

The invention of the light bulb helped to brighten our world and enabled us to innovate, grow, and create better communities. Yet, the use of artificial light has morphed into an addiction that has seen our sleeping hours and health plummet to all-time lows.

we’re not out in the wild anymore, and our modern amenities do make life nice and comfy.

your genetics haven’t changed much from your ancestors who lived closer to nature. Genetic adaptions can take thousands of years.

Humans, as well as other organisms, have evolved to adjust to predictable patterns of light and darkness. These patterns establish our internal clocks and hormonal cycles every day of our lives.

The lack of consistency may be one of the biggest issues of all. The irregular sleeping hours prevents your brain from settling into a pattern, creating a state of perpetual “jet lag.” It’s not just how you sleep, but when you sleep, that helps to create the best version of you. It’s critical to create a smart sleep schedule in our world today, and it starts with getting our buns up in the morning.

Being Part of the Early Riser Club Has Benefits

In 2008 a study from the University of North Texas found that students who identified themselves as morning people earned significantly higher grades.

Waking up earlier obviously isn’t the only factor with getting good grades, but it’s definitely a correlation to take notice of.

early birds are more proactive than evening people, and so they tend to do well in business.

morning people also anticipate problems better and minimize them more effectively.

It’s not that people who identify themselves as early risers are better people, or better at everything for that matter. Other studies suggest that night-lovers tend to be smarter and more creative than morning types, have a better sense of humor and can be more outgoing in some instances. The big issue is, according to the Harvard Business Review, is that night owls are out of sync with the typical corporate schedule, and miss out on critical opportunities more often because their timing is off.

you’re health is up to par to create the life you really want. This leads to the reality that you’re health is radically improved when you’re honoring your body’s natural hormonal clock. Humans are designed to be up during the day and sleeping at night.

Not a Morning Person?

day. It’s a very empowering feeling to have accomplished so much long before other people have even gotten out of bed. Various studies show that morning people tend to exhibit character traits like optimism, satisfaction, and conscientiousness.

Leo Babauta from the wildly popular website Zen Habits recommends using The Gradual Method when changing your sleep schedule. Rather than making the decision to suddenly get up at 6 a.m. when you normally get up at 8 a.m., take gradual 15 minute increments off you’re wake up time until you get to your desired destination.

This is a much more graceful way to do it. Often times when people decide to get up early, they throw their sleep cycle into such a shocked state that they’re more tired and irritated, plus creating a neuro-association to more pain in waking up early. This causes you to burn through your will power within days and revert back to your old habits before you know it.

how do you resist the urge to just hit the snooze alarm and forfeit you’re commitment to getting up?
Leo Babauta offered these three suggestions, and I have to say they’re pretty brilliant:

1. Get excited. The night before, think of one thing you’d like to do in the morning that excites you. It could be something you want to write, or a new yoga routine, or meditation, or something you’d like to read, or a work project that’s got you fired up. In the morning, when you wake up, remember that exciting thing, and that will help motivate you to get up.

2. Jump out of bed. Yes, jump out of bed. With enthusiasm. Jump up and spread your arms wide as if to say, “Yes! I am alive! Ready to tackle the day with open arms and the gusto of a driven maniac.” Seriously, it works.

3. Put your alarm across the room. If it’s right next to you, you’ll hit the snooze button. So put it on the other side of the room, so you’ll have to get up (or jump up) to turn it off. Then, get into the habit of going straight to the bathroom to pee once you’ve turned it off. Once you’re done peeing, you’re much less likely to go back to bed. At this point, remember your exciting thing.
If you didn’t jump out of bed, at least stretch your arms wide and greet the day.

Wake up your senses. When you get out of bed get your senses stimulated with something good. A common thing to do is to get that coffee or tea brewing and drink it. The smell, taste, and touch are all enlivening for you senses.

I’m a huge advocator of drinking a big glass or two of water first thing in the morning. I call this an “inner bath.” This will replenish your hydration levels that went down while sleeping, help your body to clear out metabolic waste products, and give you a sensory stimulation to help wake up your body.

There are so many things that will automatically get your mind and body stimulated when you’re exposed to them. Try these things out and start your day with real momentum.

Get up when the sun rises. It might be challenging at first, but after less than a couple of weeks, your body will adapt to that pattern and you’ll feel much more rested and refreshed when you wake up. You can break the old pattern of being up at night “tired and wired” by being early to rise and having a natural release of cortisol, then going to bed earlier and taking advantage of the natural release of melatonin.

Earl y to Rise Power Tip

Go to bed within 30 minutes of the same time each night and wake up at the same time each day.

a consistent sleep schedule is important for your health.

Try to avoid staying up much later just because you’re off the next day. Actually go to bed and get up so that you can use that day to do the things you want. I promise you

Humans are unique in the fact that many of us get dressed up just to go to bed.

# Chapter 19 - Dress for the occasion

Putting on your PJ’s can be like a mental trigger to relax and wind down for the day.

The reality is, you’re not just wearing clothes that only your inner circle of friends and family can see you in (unless you’re going to a Pajama Jammy Jam) but you’re also putting on clothes that will inherently affect the quality of your sleep.

It’s important to realize the fact that your body is better at keeping itself warm than keeping itself cool, so you’ll make it easier on yourself by wearing fewer and looser clothes to bed.

In a Dutch study, scientist had participants wear thermosuits to lower their skin temperature less than one degree Celsius (without affecting core body temperature) to measure its impact on sleep. The study results showed that the participants didn’t wake up as much during the night and the amount of time spent in stages three and four (deep sleep) had increased.

I’m not saying that you have to freeze your tootsies off just to get better sleep, but I am saying that if you’re used to dressing up like an Eskimo to hop in the sack, you might want to consider pulling off a layer or two.

The form and fit of your bedtime clothing is more significant than any fashion statement you can make. Wearing tight, restrictive clothing to bed is a huge sleep mistake you need to avoid. Clothing that is too tight can literally cut off the flow of your lymphatic system. Your lymphatic system is the cellular “waste management” system of your body, and an important part of your immune system. It transports and circulates extracellular fluid throughout your body, and you actually have four times more lymph fluid than you have blood.

It’s through the lymphatic system that toxic substances can move out of the body. If it’s cut off in any way, it’s like bending a water hose and blocking its ability to flow out. The water pressure will swell, and you can mess up your internal pluming or worse.

Numerous studies are now confirming the link between breast cancer and habitual bra wearing.

it was found that women who do not use bras developed more muscle tissue to naturally support the breasts, they had greater nipple lift (in relation to their shoulders), and women who wore bras had actually accelerated breast sagging.

At night while you’re sleeping is an obvious time to go bra-free and cut your risk of major problems from wearing a bra 24-hours a day.

The best clothing for bed will be non-restricting and hypoallergenic

Be comfortable, and get comfortable with your own body being more free. There are countless attractive options for bed attire if that’s important to you.

Oxytocin is a potent anti-stress hormone. It reduces signs and symptoms of depression, combats negative effects of cortisol, and helps regulate blood pressure. It’s also been shown to decrease intestinal inflammation and improve gut motility as well.

Dress for the Occasion Power Tip #1

Take bedtime as an optimal opportunity to go bra-free. This is a great start to improving your health and cutting down on your programmed bra dependency. For the fellas, avoid wearing tight underwear to bed that keep your testicles pressed against your body. You’re potentially overheating your family jewels, and not allowing them to extend and retract based on a more natural temperature.

you can rock these glasses that block blue light and give everything a much safer, softer, orange tint.

Since the beginning of time, humans have had a constant interaction with the earth.

# Chapter 20 - Get grounded

Today, in our industrialized world, many people go days, weeks, or even longer without coming in contact with the surface of the earth itself.

Scientist are discovering that this is having a huge impact on our health.

Overwhelming research is mounting that shows the impressive benefits the earth’s electromagnetic surface has on the human body.

the human body is highly conductive. We, like the earth, are running on electromagnetic energy. Our nervous system is like internal wiring that’s transmitting information throughout our entire body. We’re also made of minerals, and our tissues hold water, so we are very much like a walking, talking, conductive battery.

Bottom line: You may not be able to see it, but you are highly conductive. You give off and receive energy every second of every day. The misuse and misunderstanding of your body’s electrical system is a catalyst for chronic health problems.

How does this relate to you, the earth, and your health?

Currently, over 90 percent of physician visits are for stress and inflammatory-related issues.

It may sound a little strange, but touching the earth may be the biggest key to eliminating our issues with chronic inflammation.

Inflammation Nation

Inflammation, in particular, is a natural function facilitated by a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil. Neutrophils deliver reactive oxygen species (also known as free radicals) to the site of an injury or need. These free radicals carry a positive charge that will tear harmful bacteria apart and break apart damaged cells to create room for healthy cells to move in and repair tissues. Pretty cool, right?

Inflammation is not supposed to be a catastrophic thing. The real problem arises when free radical activity goes unchecked and some of those free radicals can leak into the surrounding tissue and damage healthy cells. This is the real cause of inflammation, and most people are dealing with this at chronic levels on a day-to-day basis.

Antioxidants carry free electrons that neutralize free radicals and stop overly-aggressive oxidation right in it’s tracks. Inflammation is reduced, and health is improved.

The reality is that you can eat high antioxidant foods until you’re blue in the face (from eating a lot of blueberries, of course) but this isn’t going to swing the battle of oxidation in your favor as much as you think.

First of all, the antioxidants need to be in the right form, and conventional food processing techniques tend to strip the antioxidant potency from our food.
Secondly, the dietary antioxidants have to withstand the digestive process, make their way through the gut lining, and hopefully find their way into your blood.
Thirdly, dietary antioxidants have been found to pale in comparison to your body’s own endogenous antioxidant capabilities. The ability of your liver to support production of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase, for example, is more potent than any antioxidant you can consume. The key is getting your body into the right state so that your organs and tissues can do the great job they already know how to do. Lastly, it’s been discovered that the number one source of free electrons is actually the source of where all of our food comes from: the earth itself.

Scientist have discovered that the earth’s surface is brimming with free electrons that are readily absorbed by the human body when they come in contact with each other.

Researchers are calling this connection with the human body and the earth “grounding” or “earthing.”

Grounding increases the surface charge on red blood cells and thereby reduces blood viscosity and clumping. Grounding appears to be one of the simplest and yet most profound interventions for helping reduce cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events.

Reduction in inflammation as a result of earthing has been documented with infrared medical imaging and with measurements of blood chemistry and white blood cell counts. The logical explanation for the anti-inflammatory effects is that grounding the body allows negatively charged antioxidant electrons from the Earth to enter the body and neutralize positively charged free radicals at sites of inflammation. Flow of electrons from the Earth to the body has been documented.

earthing has a measurable impact on stress reduction by shifting the autonomic nervous system from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance, improving heart rate variability, and normalization of muscle tension.

What about Sleep?

study found that the patients who were grounded during sleep had reduced night-time levels of cortisol and an overall normalization of cortisol secretion during the day.

Subjective reporting by the study participants also indicated that grounding during sleep improved sleep quality, reduced pain, and lowered stress.

Getting yourself grounded can have a life-changing impact on your sleep quality.

Today you can utilize incredible earthing technology that brings the benefits of the earth’s energy right into your home.

The above sleep study utilized grounding products to connect the test subjects with the earth, and trigger all of the impressive results they received.

it’s absolutely critical to get your body in contact with the earth on a regular basis to displace the positive charge you’re carrying, absorb free electrons to improve your recovery, hormones, and heart health, and most importantly to get a great night’s sleep.

Get Grounded Power Tip #1

Get your direct Vitamin G. Make it a regular practice to get some quality time with your feet on the ground.

It’s best to get your Vitamin G (your daily interaction with the earth) from the soil and grass itself.

Get Grounded Power Tip #2

The earthing products allow you to not have to shift your life around too much to get the benefits of earthing. You can simply continue doing things you normally do: work at your computer, sleep, etc., and be connected to the earth the whole time.

these items can be a great alternative to get the benefits you need.

Get Grounded Power Tip #3

Because grounding has been proven to sync your body’s circadian clock with the normal diurnal patterns of the earth, getting grounded after a flight is a powerful thing to do.

Humans are creatures of habit and habitat.

# Chapter 21 - Ritualize your night

Your brain loves to fall into patterns so that it can free up space to do other things. The more unconscious competencies we have, the more apt we are to have greater success and productivity.

What is an unconscious competency?

1. Unconscious incompetence — when you’re doing something wrong and you don’t know you’re doing it wrong 
2. Conscious incompetence — when you’re doing something wrong but you know you’re doing it wrong 
3. Conscious competence — when you’re doing something right but you have to consciously focus on doing it the right way 
4. Unconscious competence — when you’re doing something right and you don’t even have to think about it

putting the things that you’ve learned in this book into action will put you in a phase of conscious competence.

To put getting great sleep every night on cruise control, it’s simply a matter of ritualizing things just like when you first learn to drive. The word ritual is derived from the Latin word ritus meaning “a proven way of doing something.”
A ritual is a small sequence of step-by-step actions that put you in a certain mood, state or frame of mind for getting something done.

a regular bedtime ritual will help you wind down and prepare your body for the best sleep possible.

Get in the Mood

Read some fiction: It’s not a surprise that kids sleep better than most adults.
Reading fiction or having someone else read you fiction is powerful for relaxing our overused, analytical left-brain. There are few things more capable of disconnecting you from your stress, worries, and tension than escaping to another world within the pages of a book. Non-fiction can be okay if it’s a biography or something along those lines. But the best bet is too avoid the analytical, methodical, teaching, or training types of books.

You can read in your bedroom, just not in your bed if you can’t handle the reading rainbow juice.

Take a bath: A warm bath or shower shortly before bed can help you unwind and relax. Water by itself can have a very calming effect, but adding aromatherapy or magnesium bath salts to the equation can make it even better.

Be sure that the water isn’t too hot or you run the risk of raising your core body temperature too much. Also, be sure that you don’t hop right out and go straight to bed. Allow several minutes for your core temperature to come back down, or some experts recommend finishing up with a cold bath or shower for this purpose.

Journaling: This is a powerful practice that some of the most successful people in the world do. From Oprah, to Tony Robbins, journaling has been a consistent part of their lives. For the intents of a pre-bedtime ritual, you can use your journal to capture stray thoughts; to get any of the random ideas out of your head and out onto the paper. That alone will help free up mental space.

Gratitude log: Part of the reason people have anxiety and trouble sleeping is a fixation on the things they haven’t done and what they don’t have. If you’re reading this right now, chances are you are far more fortunate than you realize, and you may have gotten out of touch with just how much you have to be grateful for.
You can use a gratitude log to simply capture three to five things that you were grateful for today. It could be big things, it could be small things. Just the act of paying attention and writing them down to end your day will make you more receptive to all of the good things that happen that we end up taking for granted.

Meditation and/or prayers: I remember when I was little; my grandmother would always have me say my prayers before I go to bed. The prayer ended with me asking for the people I love to be protected. I remember saying each person I could think of by name. My grandmother was incredibly patient with me, because that list would be pretty long sometimes. In # Chapter 16, we talked in-depth about the positive affects of meditation on sleep quality. The results are real, but only useful if you use it.

Evening Ritual Checklist:
[ ] Electronic screens off 90 minutes (minimum) before bed [ ] Stretch and/or bath or shower [ ] Read some fiction [ ] Brush your teeth [ ] Use the bathroom [ ] Journal [ ] Meditation, prayers, or give gratitude [ ] Lay down in bed to sleep [ ]Time to say goodnight

The human body is brilliantly designed to utilize sleep to improve virtually every function that you have. You don’t plug into a socket. You are made anew by honoring your body and getting the sleep you require.

To be great at something, you have to make a study of it.

Ritualize It Power Tip #1

things can come up and interrupt the flow of your evening rituals. Roll with it, be flexible, and do the very best you can to stay on track. It’s not about being perfect by any means, but it is about being aware of what you need to do, and consistently putting a priority on yourself.

Do your best to work with your body and your body will work with you.

your best is usually a lot more than you think it is.

Ritualize It Power Tip #2

To really ensure that you make your evening ritual “automated,” take action to follow it as close as possible for a minimum of 30 days. In the beginning, you have to experiment a bit to find out what works best for you, but once you find it, it’s all about consistency from there.
