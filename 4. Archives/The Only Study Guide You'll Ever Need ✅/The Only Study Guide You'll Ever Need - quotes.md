A good teacher is like a row of lights illuminating a dark pathway. Teachers don’t walk the road for you, but rather point you through the twists and turns in a way that makes you feel like the destination is in reach. Without them, the path is dark.

if a good teacher is the light on a dark path, I needed to create my own torch.

When we talk about getting started, maybe results day is the place to begin. Rather than looking at the textbooks or piles of notes, think of the overarching goal and how you want to feel on that day.
You will never be able to guarantee grades but you can guarantee how you approach them. You get to choose how hard you work and how to optimise your life to make learning feel fun. Results day is not a day at all. Results day is just a mindset and it starts now.

we are going to focus on revision tactics to optimise your performance in our current school system but it is important to recognise that grades are not everything.

school isn’t just a tick box: memorise a few pages, achieve a letter on a piece of paper and happily move on.
School is a stepping stone in your journey to self-growth (deep, I know!). The more you learn, the greater your world perspective and the better equipped you are to tackle the challenges you’ll face in the future.

School is just a stepping stone. Grades or not, it is a place for you to learn and grow. The whole idea of school is to shape you and challenge you so you become a person with well-informed and fully fledged opinions.

Understanding yourself as a student is important so that you can take the best actions for you.

Reputation can be seen as a compliment – in a way, it was nice that people expected me to do well. However, at the same time, the pressure that came with being a high achiever heightened my stress levels.

We all make judgements about how teachers feel about us, and if you feel like a teacher has no hope for you to achieve higher, you may fall into the trap of giving up, or settling for lower than what you believe you’re capable of.

The causes of a lack of academic motivation can be broken down to three main factors: lack of inspiration, conformity and circumstance. [[Les causes d'un manque de motivation scolaire]]

All three are valid but you can still find a way to work with these factors and find some motivation.

## LAZINESS

I like to call this a ‘lack of inspiration’.

We’ve been trained to tailor our lives to what we find immediately interesting. If we don’t like something, we swipe. But when this translates to schoolwork, things get tough. Unfortunately, we can’t just study the subjects we’re interested in. There are other skills we have to learn, whether we like them or not. We don’t absorb new concepts in six seconds. We can’t swipe up when the test question gets hard.

you’ve come to see learning as an avoidable chore, rather than something exciting. It is here we need to light that fire again.

You need to start seeing why this difficult subject is so incredible and loved (as hard as that might feel!).

These tasks are making you a better problem solver and solution finder.

If you hate a subject, dare to ask yourself: why? Is it just hard and that makes you feel insecure? Do your friends not like it? Or is it just that you don’t know how it could be interesting? If the latter, maybe it’s up to you to inspire yourself. It is easy to find motivation when you see why learning something is valuable.

These are mental aspects of laziness, the barriers that stop you taking action. We’ll be tackling the practical aspects of laziness and smashing procrastination with easily implementable systems as the book goes on.

## CONFORMITY

We would never admit it, but half of what we like, what we do and what we believe is down to the people around us.

The idea of conformity is simple. We subconsciously copy others to benefit ourselves.

We copy people in positions of authority because they have influence and/or are experts. We trust their opinions and systems because we believe they will benefit us. The list goes on. Conformity is not inherently bad.

Sometimes you have to choose when to conform or not to optimise a certain benefit.

You can pursue doing well at school and be cool and have a good social life. Remember that!

## CIRCUMSTANCES

quite possibly the most difficult source of demotivation to combat is your circumstances.

Being a student is so tough. Seriously. The academic system pretends that exams are our whole lives, ignoring the nuance of everything that makes us, us.

I want you to know that this book sees that. This book recognises you as a complex human. This book recognises that the grade you get will not show everything behind the scenes, and that a pass grade for one person will merit the same congratulations of top grades for another. This book is an invitation to motivate yourself from within, taking into account everything else in your life. We all deserve to enter these exams with sharp pens blazing and brains bulging. Because at the end of the day, the details of your circumstances weren’t your choice. But the choice you do have is how you react to it. You’ve got this.

## Let’s think about how to light that fire.
[[Les différentes sources de motivation]] - [[Comment combiner vos deux types de motivations]] 
Motivation either comes from intrinsic or extrinsic sources.

Intrinsic motivation stems from a love of learning and the process itself. It’s about finding enough joy in the act of studying that you don’t mind spending another hour on it.

sometimes it is the extrinsic sources of motivation that pull us along in the short term. These are external rewards, such as the grades themselves, verbal praise from parents, or winning a bet if you get a certain percentage. Extrinsic motivation is guided by outcomes. You don’t need to care about learning as long as you get the result you want. Extrinsic motivation starts with identifying your long-term sources of motivation, such as a job or university, and understanding that all the effort you invest now will pay off for Future You.

Both forms of motivation are useful, but intrinsic motivation is usually more sustainable. If you can find a way to make the process more enjoyable, as opposed to only looking at the outcome, you will likely put more time and effort in, resulting in good grades anyway.

It’s not about the what, nor the how in goal-setting – it’s about the why.

Your why should be long-term. I like to think of goal-setting as two-tiered. First, define the high-level long-term goal. Then follow with smaller, more manageable blocks that serve that higher purpose.

What is your why?
Motivation is a feeling and thus not a reliable reason to study every day. Get clear on your why, and channel it to set up systems and habits which keep you going even when the feeling fades.

## FIXED VS GROWTH MINDSET
[[Les deux états d'esprits]]
A lot of research has been done on working out what makes the most successful students succeed. Interestingly, it is not natural intelligence or IQ. It is mindset and consistency. Perhaps the biggest takeaway in this whole section is that you define your work ethic.

A fixed mindset is the belief that you are not naturally suited to something.

A growth mindset on the other hand is the recognition that you will struggle and get things wrong but you can always learn and do better. ^a8f37f

The power of the word ‘yet’ is enough to transform grades, how you feel about rejection and even life paths.

![[Einstein - quotes#^3]]

motivation is not a gift from the gods that blesses just a lucky few of us, nor is it a one-time thing that you achieve once and have forever. Motivation is a daily choice, one helped by changing your mindset, recognising what is holding you back and then putting systems in place that help you stay disciplined when motivation fades.
# CHAPTER 2 THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM

- [[Le système académique]]
- [[Notation standardisée]]
- [[Les raisons de prendre ses études au sérieux]]
```

it is just that: a system

The idea that exams are the best way to test young people is not fact, it is a decision that has been made. The existence of school rankings, memory-based questions and employing a standard metric to measure the answers is a choice.

You do not have a choice in how you are tested. Whether the exams suit your style of learning or not, you will have to take them.
What you do have a choice in is how you approach the system. How you use it to truly learn and how you can optimise the style of testing to give yourself the most options in life.

This is a reminder that though we must slay the exams to give ourselves options, we can meaningfully critique our system in a way which is empowering. We can see school as a game – and one which we are going to win.

learning about something is not the same as learning something.

## STANDARDISED METRICS
[[Notation standardisée]]
![[Einstein - quotes#^2]]


I do believe that every single person is flexible and capable of learning whatever they want but it is useful to consider that certain methods of assessment suit certain people’s skillsets more than others.

one good thing about such a standardised method of testing is that you can learn the system like a game. The more rigid it is, the easier it is to understand and optimise for. This knowledge is empowering.

## SO, WHY TRY?
[[Les raisons de prendre ses études au sérieux]]
The system isn’t perfect. You can probably see that now.

There are so many reasons why it’s important to take learning into your own hands as a teenager.

### SCHOOL IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT

The more you put in, the more you get out.

you can control how you approach it.

As a teenager, your sole, full-time job is studying.

The more you find joy in the process of learning, and the more you can view it as useful to your own interests, the more likely you are to organically succeed!

### OPTIONS

If you have no idea what you want to do with your life, trying hard at school is one way to broaden your horizons.

It is a radical act of self-love and self-compassion to care about your education because everything you learn will indirectly help Future You.

### DISCIPLINE AND HARD WORK

Hard work is, as the name suggests, hard.

The world is so full of opportunity if you choose to see it that way.

If you can teach yourself how to solve academic problems you don’t enjoy, you’ll be better equipped to tackle all the unpleasant problems in your later life.

You are a tiny agent in a massive system but you have so much power to create change.

### THE REINFORCING FEEDBACK LOOP OF SUCCESS

According to positive psychology, success breeds success, which breeds more success. School is an opportunity for you to define what success means to you and optimise for it.

Feeling successful makes you reach for further success, however you define it.

### THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM IS A GAME, AND YOU CAME TO WIN
it’s a very specific game with very specific rules, and therefore you can find a formula to win. Thinking of exams as a game you play against an arbitrary system takes the pressure out of them. Whether the style of the academic system suits you or not, you can learn how to strategise to get the best out of it.

If you can learn how to beat this system as a teenager then you’ll be well prepared for other challenges in life.

There’s a long way to go to developing student-specific growth, learning and critical thinking without the terrifying pressure associated with exam grades. But for now, this is where we are. The game will teach you so many life lessons, if only you choose to play – and win.

# CHAPTER 3 HOW WE LEARN
```ad-note

- [[La technique SAAD]]
- [[Les répétitions espacées]]
- [[Les rappels actifs]]
- [[Faites des associations]]
- [[La difficulté désirable]]
```

Rather than spending more hours at the desk, I needed to change the techniques I was using to begin with. Rather than working harder at every study session, I needed to be strategic about when I was revising and how often.

## <u>S</u>AAD: Spaced repetition
[[Les répétitions espacées]]
The idea is that you review information again, multiple times, at set intervals from first learning it.

Every time you review the information, you reset your memory back to 100 per cent. The idea is that you catch your memory just as you’re about to forget what you learned.

the more you review a concept, the longer the gap you can leave before reviewing it again.

It’s about working smarter, for less time, but consistently. Reviewing concepts for five minutes every day with spaced repetition is the scientifically backed secret to good grades.

It’s not about revising for longer, just more frequently.

## S<u>A</u>AD: Active recall
[[Les rappels actifs]]
Stephen Kosslyn split up human learning into two overarching maxims: ‘Think it Through’ and ‘Make and Use Associations’.

```ad-help
title: What does it mean to Think It Through?
collapse: open
icon: question
color: 0, 255, 0
``` 

The idea is that the more you are forced to think deeply about an idea, the more you remember it. Turning over a concept in your head strengthens the synaptic connections in your brain, which are the gaps between neurons and allow the transfer of information in the brain. Continuously revisiting thoughts strengthens the neural pathways to accessing that information, just like being forced to recall facts is more beneficial than passively reading them on a page.

The principle of Think It Through leads us to the A in SAAD revision: active recall.

We don’t like to think. Even when we revise, we would prefer to reread our notes, highlight words in a textbook or annotate text rather than stare at a blank page and recite our existing knowledge.
We look for shortcuts.

Without actively recalling information, you don’t actually know what you don’t know.

When you are passive, it is easy, but you reveal nothing to yourself. When you are active, it is uncomfortable, challenging and requires mental effort. Which is why it is the most effective use of your time.

Active recall goes against human nature, as we always want to find the path of least resistance with revision. Remember, the harder the revision feels, the more effective it probably is. Get that brain working.

## SA<u>A</u>D: Associations
[[Faites des associations]]
‘Make and Use Associations’, fits into active recall but deserves its own mention.
Why is this important?

Some people think that learning something distinctly different from what you already know will save you getting confused when in reality, a powerful principle of revision techniques is connecting what you’re learning to existing knowledge.
Making associations and using them.

You can’t expect to learn a brand new concept with no foundational knowledge to root it.
‘Foundational material’ is actually the backbone of additional information because it allows you to have an organised mental structure over time.

If you can find a way to make your revision connected, meaningful and built upon past knowledge, you will create rich retrieval cues to prompt you. And this is where long-term knowledge starts.

## SAA<u>D</u>: Desirable difficulty
[[La difficulté désirable]]
If you hate a subject, you probably just find it hard.

Desirable difficulty is about realising when something is hard and choosing to do it anyway. The last thing we want to do is torture ourselves in our free time with subjects we find hard but half the pain of revision is in choosing to start. SAAD revision asks you to know your academic pain points and, rather than ignoring them, attack them. With bows and arrows and guns and flamethrowers and an army of flashcards. This is how you will grow.

However, desirable difficulty is not just about choosing to revise the hard subjects but asking yourself during your revision if you’re actually having to think. More than simply doing active recall, question how hard you’re finding it. If it’s easy, amazing! Do the harder stuff. Maybe you’re ready to try a past paper, apply your knowledge to practice questions or to explain these concepts to a friend

How has the education system got away with expecting students to take exams to determine their future life prospects without ever actively teaching you *how* to study?

The SAAD framework gives you a base to understand why these revision techniques are so effective.

### DITCH AESTHETICS
[[La beauté des cartes de révisions]]
aesthetics are not scientifically backed to improve grades. Unfortunately.

This chapter will show you ten scientifically backed SAAD revision methods which are less pretty but much more functional. If pretty notes truly make you happy, keep making them. But for the sake of your exams, do the following too.

doing well in an exam requires three main stages of studying. Whenever you come to revise, ask yourself which of the three stages below it fits into!

### Understand → Learn → Apply
[[Processus d'apprentissage]]
The process of understanding begins in the classroom. It continues with reading study guides, watching videos, asking your teacher and peers for help, and wrestling with the content until you reach that ‘ah-ha!’ moment.

It’s not worth embarking on the memory-based revision techniques until you confidently understand the topic at hand.

One of my biggest pieces of advice is to use class-time to just listen. During my A levels, I would skim over the lesson content in the textbook beforehand to familiarise myself with key terms. For the rest of that hour, I just listened, asked questions and tried to grasp the concept.

The second step is learning. It is one thing to finally understand something; it is another to be able to recall and retrieve specific information from the concept when prompted.

Most people skip from the ‘I understand’ and go straight to the ‘let’s apply this in an exam’ stage. Memorise, test yourself on, and learn, the content.

The third step is application. This is where you test yourself, pick up practice test papers and attempt to prove your knowledge in the way exams will reward you for. Practice papers elevate you from knowing the information to using it in the very specific way that exam boards want.

In this chapter, we are going to cover ten revision techniques which are tried and tested to help you thrive in the exams. Some of them require more time, others need a bit of creativity, but all of them work.

It’s important to actually try out these revision techniques to find out which ones work best for you. For each one that you master, you’re adding to your study vocabulary. You’re learning the language of revision so that by the time exam season hits, you’re fluent.

**Spaced repetition** is all about revisiting the same information at specific points in time to combat the forgetting curve of human memory. Recall information many times at the start and progressively less often as it enters your long-term memory.
**Active recall** means generating knowledge from your brain, even if it’s hard. Instead of looking at the information on my flashcard, I write a question to force myself to produce the information myself.
**Association** means building on your prior knowledge. These techniques invite you to make connections between different topics to give you rich retrieval cues for the information.
**Desirable difficulty** means these techniques aren’t going to be easy.
Passive revision gives you a break. It’s too easy and so you learn less. Instead, if you test yourself and wrestle with your knowledge in ways which reveal your difficulties you will ultimately learn the content in a much more meaningful way.

Récap SAAD

The harder your revision is, the easier the exams will be. Future You is already thanking you.

Make sure you’re learning the right information.
Print off the ‘specification’ for your syllabus which can be found on the exam board’s website. It has a long list of points from the people who write the exam papers and tells you what you need to know.

The specification becomes a checklist of items to guide your revision.

Use your textbook, class notes, teacher’s notes and the specification to condense the most essential information that you’ll need for that exam!

take a moment to ‘diagnose’ your subjects and what they demand of you. This is one of the best things I do to guide my revision!

With some subjects, you can start anywhere.

All of the revision techniques below are useful, but it’s up to you to work out what your subjects require of you and use these techniques to help you.

Get clear on how you will be marked and how your subject works!

### LEARNING METHODS
#### 1. Flashcards
[[Les flashcards]]
Flashcards should be three things: short, meaningful and connected.

Short, as in, short-short. As in, a few words on one flashcard. No long sentences, no overkill explanation, nothing that you can merely copy from your notes.

The beauty of flashcards is that they are straightforward to make and revise from. The downside is the discipline required to make them. I cannot recommend this enough: make flashcards as you go.

However, you have to find what works best for you. If flashcard apps get you distracted, ditch them. If you always lose handwritten flashcards, consider using online cloud-based methods.

More than anything, start. Practice makes perfect with flashcards and their benefits are long-lasting. Remember, the more effort you put into simplifying information now, the easier life will be when you come to revise!

It’s important to find a method that works for you but don’t be fooled by the lure of aesthetics. As long as it’s concise, meaningful and SAAD – it’ll work in your favour.

#### 2. Summarisation from memory
[[Les résumés de votre mémoire]]
We all love notes.

Notes are easy to do, can be made while blaring loud music and require little mental effort.
And that’s the issue.

However, a friendly first step to studying if you do love note-taking is to summarise with intention. Take your lengthy class notes and aim to condense them into a few essential lines. The trick to make this effective is to do it half from memory. Read through your class notes, perhaps check the textbook, and when you feel like you’ve got a good grasp, challenge yourself to summarise without just copying.

If physically writing the summary takes too long, you can say it aloud, either to yourself or explain it to a friend. Actively teaching someone is another useful way to test your understanding.

#### 3. Chunking, chaining and telling a story
[[Découper, associer et raconter une histoire]]
Chunking

In the cognitive neuroscience of memory, there is a useful technique for recall called ‘Chunking’.

This method asks you to separate whatever information you’re trying to learn into bitesized nuggets that you then create individual associations to. Each ‘chunk’ of information is made from dividing something large into small units which are related to each other, such as similar words, numbers or phrases.

This revision technique uses the second A of SAAD revision techniques – associations. You are creating a rich association to the knowledge through chunking it into something more accessible. This is why mnemonics and acronyms like SAAD are helpful ways to remember things.

Chaining

The idea is that you break down a process or event into a sequence of facts and associate each to the one before. Just as the question, ‘How are you?’ prompts a response like, ‘Good’, this technique is powerful because it means every fact naturally cues the recall of another.

Telling a Story

A way to use chaining and chunking together effectively is through storytelling. Creating a story forces you to break down lots of information into manageable pieces which connect to each other in a logical sequence.

1. Break down the process or event that you’re trying to learn into five to ten key details.
2. Create a story linking the details in order.

Another reason that turning facts into a story is successful for long-term memory retention is because you are creating more associations. Here, each part of the story is logically chained to the last and cues your recall of the next.

This technique truly makes revision fun. It is light-hearted, though admittedly time-consuming and not worth using for everything, but is a great way to break up long stints of working through past papers.

Storytelling counts as SAAD revision when the story is repeated often and in expanding intervals (spaced repetition), requires you to recall the characters and storyline from memory (active recall), is built on prior knowledge and chained to the next step of the story (association) and uses a storyline which appropriately distils what you need to learn (desirable difficulty).

#### 4. Blurting
[[Griffoner ce que vous connaissez]]
To do this, take a concept or chapter you want to revise:
1. Write yourself a few prompts related to the topic to help jog your memory.
2. Without looking at any notes or your textbook, write down everything you can remember from that chapter. ‘Blurt out’ all your knowledge from memory. Detail processes, list out vocabulary, define key terms. All of it. You can even set yourself a timer.
3. When you’ve written everything you can remember, compare your blurted knowledge to an official textbook, mark scheme or notes.
Suddenly, you’ve got evidential proof of what you do and don’t know.

Blurting is easy to put off because it is mentally taxing. It forces you to stare your knowledge in the face and be honest with where you’re at, without the luxury of hiding behind a textbook. However, it is an essential self-assessment tool to show you what you need to spend more time on. The more you repeat blurting the same concepts, the stronger your knowledge in them will become.

Blurting became my go-to technique for almost any subject. From recalling maths formulas to drama practitioners’ theories, it saved me time and forced me to consolidate my knowledge.

#### 5. Sherlock’s Mind Palace
[[Le palace mental de Sherlock Holmes]]
This technique is one of the most creative and effective I’ve ever tried, if used correctly. It’s best for memorising long processes, definitions that must be remembered word-for-word (did someone say science mark schemes?) and anchoring difficult-to-remember ideas to something more concrete.

The idea is that you associate a word or sentence to a specific object or action. You anchor each part of a concept repeatedly until it is ingrained in your memory. When you need to recall the information, you use the objects or actions as a prompt to list off each element of the concept.

This technique is built on the two As of SAAD revision – active recall and association. Through associating new concepts to your existing knowledge of a physical space, you are creating rich retrieval cues to recall the information.

Sherlock’s Mind Palace is incredible for learning processes. However, one of the reasons Sherlock was able to remember so many niche facts was through associating them to different objects in his house.

#### 6. Object association: An extension of the Mind Palace
[[L'association d'objet - une extension du palace mental de Sherlock Holmes]]
It’s not just things in your home that can be used to help you remember facts and processes – think about the individual details of any object you know well, even those you’ll have in the exam hall.
Object association is powerful when you successfully link any abstract idea you need to remember to something physical you know well.

Why does this strange technique work? Coming back to the framework of SAAD revision techniques, this is grounded in association as it requires you to create rich retrieval cues and bring them back into your mind using active recall. Especially at the start, it is desirably difficult to remember the entire definition, so your brain must work actively.

You only have so many objects and well-known places to use, so use this sparingly but know that is highly effective.

### APPLICATION
#### 7. Textbook questions and revision guides
[[Les questions du manuels et les guides de révisions]]
Every textbook for your syllabus should provide practice questions as you’re learning the content.

Make it a habit to revisit textbook and revision guide questions even months after you covered the material in class.

Regularly revisit these bite-sized questions to refresh your understanding. The most important tip is not to read your notes or a lesson summary before answering the questions (even though it’s tempting!). In doing so, you’ll only be testing your short-term memory and you want to know what is already lodged in your brain.

##### Top tips for practice questions

When practising questions in the textbook, get good at recognising the command words. These are the first verbs you see, and they normally require different things. It’s like a hint from the exam board about what they are asking of you.

- **State**, *e.g. State the definition on the enthalpy change of combustion.*
   The exam boards want you to ‘express in clear terms’. This answer normally does not require why, how or an example. Simply write down the definition you’ve learned with as many key words as possible. If it’s 2 marks, make sure to write down at least 2 statements. If it’s 3 marks, write down 3 and so on. Other command words with a similar meaning: **Give, identify, outline**
- **Explain**, *e.g. Using Figure 12 and your own knowledge, explain how different landforms may be created by the transport and deposition of sediment along the coast.* 
   Explain questions are beasts! Here, they don’t just want you to list out your knowledge – they want you to detail ‘purposes or reasons’, work out why something is the way it is and discuss the causal factors. Again, if it’s a 3-mark question, write at least 3 points!
- **Describe**, *e.g. Describe examples of women’s work during the First World War.*
    Unlike explaining why or how something is the way it is, describing merely means stating what is there and laying out characteristics.
- **Justify**, *e.g. ‘Transnational corporations (TNCs) only bring advantages to the host country.’ Do you agree with this statement? Justify your decision.*
    This type of question could be worth many marks and often involves ethical debates. When you see this word, make sure to support a case with evidence. 
- **To what extent**, *e.g. To what extent do urban areas in lower income countries (LICs) or newly emerging economies (NEEs) provide social and economic opportunities for people?*
    For subjects like geography, this command phrase is asking you to judge the importance or success of a strategy, scheme or project. For subjects like English literature, it’s asking you to weigh up how much you agree with something.
#### 8. Practice essays
[[Faire des examens blancs]]
##### How to write practice essays for any subject

**Use past paper questions**. I recommend saving the most recent papers to practise with near to your real exam but any other questions you can get hold of are worth using. For English literature, you want to be well prepared for questions related to characters, themes, settings and relevant historical events. If you can’t find a past paper question that tackles all of these elements, either create one yourself or ask your teacher to prepare you a practice question.

**Always time yourself**. Even in the early days or if you’re just practising essay-writing for quality rather than an exam scenario, it is useful to measure how long it roughly takes you to process the question.

**Always plan your essay**. Write an outline, pick apart quotes of choice, create a running thread to tie the essay together and give yourself a helpful roadmap. I know many people who don’t plan essays. There was a time when I was one of them. But I can wholeheartedly say that planned essays are better essays. Even if you meander, spontaneously add points or go in a new direction, the clarity of an overall plan is essential, especially under timed conditions.

**Organisation and structure**. Following on from creating a plan, your essay should have a clear, easy-to-follow structure. Think about travelling to Paris. You want to follow regular, logical sign-posts to get you from A to B. You know what your destination is the whole time, and all the travel routes on the way are supporting the journey. An essay without a structure is like aiming for Paris but taking a hundred detours and ending up at the fake Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas. Just not as magical.

Every essay has a macro structure and a micro structure. [[Macro et micro structure d'une dissertation]]

The **macro** structure is its overall formation. It is how your essay flows at a high level. We love a solid **introduction** or topic sentence, **body paragraphs** which explore your idea using lots of evidence, and a gorgeous **conclusion** which ties together all your points in a summary, without adding anything new.

The **micro** structure of an essay is how each of these body paragraphs are written. There are many frameworks you can use to be successful, but it’s always a good idea to introduce a relevant point with a topic sentence, back it up with evidence, and then provide an in-depth explanation of why it answers the question. This basic structure is often referred to as **PEEL** – Point, Evidence, Explanation and Link back to the question. [[La méthode PEEL]]

P – Point: Introduce the topic you are going to discuss in this paragraph with one clear sentence.
E – Evidence: Support your point with examples, such as facts and statistics, figures, research findings, and quotes from the text.
Choose evidence you can expand upon.
E – Explanation: Show your understanding of how your given evidence supports the main point and why you have a strong argument.
L – Link to the question or context: Reinforce your original point and make sure it is relevant to the given question. You can also provide a transition to the next topic or paragraph.

Whatever you do, make sure you are factoring organisational structure into how you write your essays.

**Always use a range of words for ‘suggests’**. When your essay hinges on use of sources, figures or literary texts, the odds are you will have to infer meaning from them. Rather than repeating the same word (Pikachu, I choose you! Again . . .), memorise a list of sophisticated synonyms. Such as highlights, shows that, signifies, connotes, indicates, implies, proves that. [[Mots d'introduction de données]]

**Always ask someone to give you feedback on your essay**. Half the learning is writing the essay. The other half is understanding how you actually did. There’s a beautiful bias called ‘The Ikea Effect’, inspired by the store’s flatpack furniture that customers have to build themselves using a set of instructions. Research has shown that humans always overvalue their own creations and an Ikea customer will value the table they put together themselves over an identical table they purchased ready-made (because clearly that wonky cabinet your dad put together is art). Similarly, you will overvalue an essay you’ve written more than one written by someone else. So to overcome this, you need an objective second opinion. I understand it can feel scary, or seem like extra work, to reach out to a teacher and ask them to review your essay, but you need to do it. There is nothing more valuable than tangible feedback on your writing. Unlike science or maths, where answers are defined by a mark scheme, essay-based subjects are wonderfully subjective.

##### Top tip for essays: Relevance
When you have so many good ideas and things to talk about, it’s easy to write an essay that answers the question you wanted to be asked as opposed to the one that is actually on the paper

Relevance is one of the most important elements of a good essay response. I learned this the hard way! No matter how many quotes, historical evidence or fancy vocabulary you include, if it doesn’t answer the given question, it won’t get you the marks.

I recommend starting and ending every paragraph with a direct tie-in to the question.

#### 9. Timed essay plan
[[Plan d'examen chronométré]]
So maybe you don’t have time to write a whole essay. That’s okay.
You’re not lazy, you might just be smart. One of my favourite revision techniques is planning an essay exactly as though you’re going to write it, including all the relevant quotations and trains of thought. And time it. Force yourself to pretend that you will answer this question in an exam scenario.

But that’s the thing, how do you write a good essay plan?

The most useful first step to learning to plan essays is to start at the end. Take an existing essay you’ve written, preferably one which got a good mark, and deconstruct it to see how you structured it. In other words, produce an essay plan based on the essay you have already written, rather than the other way around. This ‘reverse outline’ is useful to identify how your thoughts evolved, which pieces of evidence you brought in to support your points and ultimately if your essay is coherent. This is an efficient way to assess how well you built on your ideas – or, conversely, scattered them.

You normally have an introduction, or at least a topic sentence, body paragraphs that present and build upon related ideas and a conclusion that relates everything back to the question and ties up your analysis with a bow.

Notice whether the paragraphs link well to one other or if there are big jumps or loose ends.

#### 10. Past papers – and how to learn from them
[[Utiliser les anciens contrôles]]
How will you use this incredible evaluation tool to learn what you didn’t know?

Make it a habit to do more with your end of chapter tests than simply reading them and shoving them in a drawer. Most end of chapter tests are made up of old past paper questions, so learning from them is like gold dust.

One framework I used to evaluate my past papers, especially in science subjects, was the [[L'acronyme MARCKS|acronym MARCKS]].

Each letter is an explanation for why you lost the mark. How can you fix your knowledge unless you know why it went wrong?

M – **Maths** error You got a question wrong due to an issue with your maths. Maybe it was a silly mistake with the numbers or you didn’t know the formula.

A – **Application** You lost the mark because you didn’t understand the application context of the question. These questions are generally worth the most marks and understandably challenging.

R – **Read the question (RTQ)** Otherwise known as a silly mistake. R means you didn’t read the specifics of the question. Did you answer another essay question? Or define a different process?

C – **Communication** You knew your stuff. You were on the right lines. But you did not express your thoughts sufficiently clearly.

K – **Knowledge** You just don’t know the content in this topic well enough. I recommend going back to number five in the learning methods earlier and blurting your knowledge to identify gaps in it.

S – **Statement** The question was a 2-marker but you only gave one point. Or the question was a whopping 6-marker and you only wrote two lines. This reason is easy to fix but equally annoying when done wrong. Always check the number of marks on offer!

After hastily marking your past paper under this framework, tally up how many of each letter you wrote. All of a sudden, you now know the primary reason this paper went wrong.

The final and most important step is to write yourself a summary note on the front of the paper with action items. Based on your MARCKS analysis, what will you do now?

Moving these action items from your paper to your to-do list is the only way they’ll get tackled. For every past paper you do, don’t miss out on the opportunity to learn from it. It’ll help you out, I promise.

### PAST PAPERS ARE THE NEW TEXTBOOK
[[Les anciens contrôles sont le nouveau manuel]]

**Step 1: Identify your knowledge gaps** Any efficient revision strategy should always involve highlighting your weak points and what you don’t already know. I usually do this by scribbling down anything and everything that I can remember from a particular topic, on plain or scrap paper (trust me, it’s not going to be a framed piece of artwork) and then I’ll compare this to my study notes to track down the missing pieces of the jigsaw. This is an example of blurting.

**Step 2: Flashcards** “What do I write on a flashcard?” is a very commonly asked question when it comes to revising, but here’s my solution:
transfer only your knowledge gaps to a carefully crafted pile of flashcards. Write the question or prompt on the front and answer on the back. Problem solved.

**Step 3: Summary sheets** At the apex of my revision funnel I’ll create a summary sheet on plain A4 paper, and this is what I’ll be using to revise from just before an exam; this is dedicated to only the information that I simply struggle to remember. Attempting to go over everything you’ve learned the night before an exam is neither a healthy goal nor manageable task, and so this is why I find summary sheets to be immensely powerful.

[[Les 5P du succès]] : "Perfect planning prevents poor performance" 

the key to unlocking productivity through planning.
[[Pourquoi faire des emplois du temps]]
This chapter will help you to establish an effective study routine, set achievable study goals and hold yourself accountable for your deadlines. Whether you’re a long-term planner or a night-before crammer, knowing how to timetable your life is an essential skill for when you need to power through your work.

Timetabling is the cure that stops you thinking about work and start doing it. It invites you to prioritise, create a high-level plan for your life based on deadlines and assign appropriate lengths of time to each task until they’re all done. It’s a way of making 24 exams feel (slightly more) manageable and empowers you to spend your time well.

One of the key secrets here is practice. The more often you plan your time, the better you get at estimating how long tasks take you.

First, we’ll review how to go about creating a study timetable, then we’ll review some of the classic do’s and don’ts and look at how to transform a list of tasks into an effective plan. The process of timetabling has three main guiding forces: the urgency of each topic in terms of your current level of understanding, the urgency of action based on upcoming deadlines and, finally, balance.

timetabling takes practice (and learning from inevitable failure).

## 1. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITY AREAS?
[[Définissez vos priorités]]
All the topics you need to revise are a scattered web in your mind; without detailing each one and quantifying your progress, you cannot actively improve how you tackle them.

Are there certain subjects where you need to achieve a certain grade to progress into what you plan to do next? Or is there one area that stands out as needing some work?

Be honest with yourself as it is the only way you’ll be able to effectively timetable your subjects. You have a limited amount of time before exams, and it’s important to allocate it efficiently.

Before you can start timetabling, you need to understand what you don’t know.

Don’t be generous. If you don’t understand a topic, brutally mark it with urgency, whether you enjoy revising it or not. I had a simple traffic light system of green, amber and red. Green meant it needed very little attention, amber required moderate revision and dark red was a problem point which begged more time.

I then added a new column to my spreadsheet: Actions. In this, I detailed the strategies I intended to use to get my problem areas to green, using SAAD techniques

Be honest with yourself and don’t skip this phase! You can’t create a plan without first knowing where to direct your energy.

I also added a simple ‘Last Reviewed’ and ‘Next Review’ section to aid my spaced repetition process (flick back to chapter 3 for a refresh of this!). Knowing when I last revised certain concepts was incredibly helpful in planning effective future revision.

## 2. DRAFT UP A TIMETABLE
[[Choisissez votre outil de planification]]
There are a range of different tools you can use to create timetables.
There are calendar functions on Notion, which is a website and app that helps you get organised, and study apps like My Study Life; you can drop tasks directly into your Google calendar or, of course, use pen and paper in a notebook or bullet journal.

I recommend having a time-to-time setup as the first column so that you can get specific with how long tasks will take you.

## 3. WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE?
[[Bloquer les temps que vous ne pouvez éviter]]
Fill in any mandatory extracurricular activities, events or classes for the week. I blocked off time for school, school activities and social activities. Colour coding is useful to see how you are dividing your time.

## 4. WHEN DO YOU WORK BEST?
[[Quand est-ce que vous travailler le mieux]]
Studies suggest that early mornings bring enhanced clarity. In planning your study sessions in advance, you can commit to an early night beforehand and get ready to smash the next day.

Whenever you work best, position your most important tasks at those times.

## 5. STICK TO THE TIMETABLE AS BEST YOU CAN BUT ADAPT IT AS YOU PRACTISE
timetables should be flexible
### THE PLANNING FALLACY
[[Faites tout pour suivre votre emploi du temps mais sachez vous adapter]]
It turns out that us humans are pretty bad at predicting how long things take us because we have a tendency to underestimate tasks and overvalue our abilities. This is called [[Le sophisme de la planification|the planning fallacy]]. It’s an optimistic bias towards thinking things take less time than they do.

One trick to help you create better estimates for future timetables is what personal development blogger Steve Pavlina coined, [[Ratio de fudge|The Fudge Ratio]]. It takes into account the planning fallacy and gives you a numerical value to make better predictions:
1. Write down everything you need to do.
2. Estimate how long each task will take you. Don’t think too much, just guess.
3. Complete the tasks while timing how long they take you. Write down this exact number.
4. Divide this actual task time by your estimate. This is your personal Fudge Ratio.

Eventually, you develop a new, more accurate intuition. You’ll have a better understanding of how long tasks actually take you and be able to make more actionable timetables.

## THE DON’TS OF TIMETABLING
### Time-to-time scheduling without ‘shuffling time’ in between
[[Ne pas prévoir d'entre-tâche]]
you need ‘shuffling’ time – a.k.a. that dead two-to-five minutes when you put your books away, take a sip of water and find your next round of revision notes.

### Too rigid
[[Être trop rigide dans vos horaires]]
Welcome to the fallacy of optimism.
Until you know how long it really takes you to get things done, be pessimistic. Always schedule more time than you know you need for a task.

There is no better feeling than being ahead on your timetable and the only way you can achieve this is by being more realistic with your timings.

### Too vague
[[Être trop vague dans ce que vous planifiez]]
It is tempting not to plan the specifics of your revision because that takes time and energy. While it is a good idea to make an overview of your week with time blocked off for certain subjects, the way to make your timetable most helpful is by specifying which area of a subject you are going to tackle.

Make sure your revision is a little less sad and a lot more SAAD! The more you think about the specifics of a task in advance, the less friction there is to just starting. So invest the time in making your timetable specific.

### Giving up on the timetable when you miss one task
[[Abandonner votre emploi du temps après avoir raté une tâche]]
You are never going to stick to your timetable perfectly.
There will always be tasks which run over, concepts you thought you understood but don’t or even surprise events which mean you can’t do any of that night’s planned revision.
That’s okay.

Missing the odd task doesn’t say anything about you. What does say something about you is what you choose to do next.

Check in with your plan. Notice where you’re at. Reshuffle. Learn from it.

### Not scheduling breaks and other life activities
[[Ne pas prévoir de pauses et d'autres activités de vies]]
The final don’t is all about hustling too hard. We’ve somehow been taught along our school career that the longer we spend revising, the better. In reality, it’s meaningful breaks that allow us to spend time more productively.
Just like you schedule your revision tasks, make sure to schedule dedicated time to relax.

## THE DO’S OF TIMETABLING

I’m sure by now you can guess some of the do’s.
- DO give yourself breaks.
- DO make your timetable flexible and generous.
- DO adapt your timetable as you go on. Stick with it even if you miss the odd task.
- DO make your timetable based on priority subjects and modules.
- DO plan tasks at the times of the day you are most effective.

Learning to schedule your time in a way that is not restrictive but also allows you to get more out of the precious time you have is an incredibly useful skill.

- [[Dire non, de manière significative]]
```

[[Qu'est ce que productivité signifie|What does productivity even really mean?]]

in reality, productivity just means spending your time well. It’s about optimising your hours to do everything you love in a meaningful way.
It’s about getting the work done efficiently so you actually have more time to spend with friends, watching shows or going on adventures.

The origins of productivity date back to the industrial era where being productive meant producing the most goods in the shortest amount of time. Factory workers had to assemble products in the most efficient way to maximise output. From this, we can generate the equation:
<center>Productivity = Output / Time</center>

But we’re not machines

So, to increase productivity and maximise knowledge retention, we can either increase the quality of our knowledge retention or decrease the time it takes to get there.

### Increase Quality of Output: The 3 Fs
#### The first F to increase the quality of the output is to enhance your Focus.

Focus = lack of distractions, such as studying in a quiet place. It is about finding a flow where your brain is engaged without deviation.

focus is also as simple as being intentional with one task at a time. Yep, one. Rather than flitting between tasks to eventually generate ‘output’, being truly productive means giving each task the mental space it deserves.

You maximise the quality of the output when intentional mental power is directed to it.

#### The second F to increase your quality of work is Forethought.

Your study session will be of a higher quality when you have planned what to cover. This also helps reduce the time spent studying through minimising friction to starting.

#### And finally, as my good friend and YouTuber Ali Abdaal often says, you are more productive when you are having Fun.

When you are enjoying what you are learning, you are more likely to take it in and show up to the next study session. Time is being spent doubly well as you are maximising the output of knowledge retention and overall happiness.

being productive is easier said than done. Most of us are not truly productive – just busy. It’s human nature not to be aware of our priorities and to just go along with where the day takes us, even if it means we end up with less time for the things we love doing.

And just because you are revising doesn’t mean you are doing good revision. When you are staring at flashcards but your mind is elsewhere, you are decreasing the useful output from that task and dragging it out so it takes up unnecessary time.

## NEVER STARTING SYNDROME
[[Le symdrome de ne jamais commencer]]
The most wonderful (and evil!) part of procrastination is that we mask it in a veil of productivity.

It’s not about choosing between relaxing or doing work, it’s about putting off things you need to do and not planning dedicated time for them in your calendar. If you know for certain the task will be done, then doing other things like calling friends or watching Netflix are not only acceptable, but productive too.

Thinking about the work is always worse than just doing it.

I now use these frameworks every time I need to get something done, whether it’s university work, YouTube projects or job applications. They help me focus on the task, find flow and ultimately enjoy the task more because I have committed to it.

### POMODORO TECHNIQUE
[[La technique Pomodoro]]
This technique uses a timer to help you break down your work into manageable 25-minute chunks separated by short breaks. It was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s – he named it pomodoro – the Italian for tomato – after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer he used as a university student.

Here’s how it works:
1. Choose a specific task, such as ‘Complete five test questions from chapter 5’.
2. Set a 25-minute timer.
3. Spend those 25 minutes focused exclusively on the task you set.
If you get distracted or stop working, you start the timer again.
From the beginning.
4. After 25 minutes, reward yourself with a five-minute break.
5. Choose another task and repeat.

Pomodoro Technique reduces all friction to just starting. You don’t need to finish all your revision in 25 minutes. You just have to start.

### MONTHLY OVERVIEWS AND WEEKLY PLANS (FORETHOUGHT)
[[Les planifications à moyens, courts et très courts termes]]
If there’s something which anchors productivity, it’s a deep understanding of your priorities.

Let’s talk about a high-level month overview.

I begin by brainstorming everything I want to get done that month, answering this from the perspective of academic, health, social and personal goals. What do I want to feel like? How do I want to be? Are there any specific things I want to explore? What do I want to learn for fun? Do I have exams coming up? Friends’ birthdays? I flick through my calendar and focus on everything that holds meaning.

Once you’ve brainstormed the high-level outcomes you want from the month, start outlining more tangible goals that follow from this.

So you’ve got your high-level monthly goals. Time to plan your week.

Break down each high-level tangible goal into smaller, more manageable weekly goals that you can slot into your calendar.

From here, you start to detail your weekly outlines. These will be your anchors for planning your week. I review my weekly overview every Sunday or early Monday morning and use it to carve out how I want to spend my time.

School is bloody stressful and living day-to-day with no roadmap of where you’re going only makes it worse. Having a feeling of control over the many things you have to do is not only helpful, but empowering. Through setting monthly goals, reviewing what worked well (and what didn’t!) for last month and setting clear priorities, you can make sure you’re giving yourself a good academic foundation and the space to just have fun.

Though it doesn’t need to be as strict as a monthly or weekly plan. You need to try out some options to learn what’s right for you. Maybe that’s daily to-do lists or writing deadlines and important dates on a calendar in your room. Whatever it is, give some structure to the fast-flowing days of secondary school.
Not only is it an incredible habit to develop for future life but it’ll give you peace of mind, I promise.

### TO-DO LISTS (FORETHOUGHT)
[[Les to-do lists]]
To-do lists are one of the easiest tools to use to understand what needs to be completed and prompt yourself to just do it. But what’s the secret to a good to-do list? While you might want to make it look beautiful, the robustness of a to-do list is in its feasibility and prioritisation. We must ask ourselves what deserves to be on that list, especially because we gain validation from the act of crossing off items.

In building to-do lists, you have a choice:
- Fill your to-do list with the simplest tasks. This means they are easier to complete, which can serve as useful motivation.
  However, this may mean you end up avoiding larger, more difficult tasks because it will take longer to get the same buzz from ticking them off.
- Adopt a system of prioritisation where you rank tasks based on both their difficulty and their urgency. Change the extent of validation you gain from completing tasks based on whether or not they are most necessary.

It is about knowing every task I need to complete, yes. But even more importantly, I recognise that tasks aren’t equal.

three simple steps to creating to-do lists . . . that actually get done : [[Créer une to-do list efficace]]

1. Brain dump. Write down every task you need to complete. Every thought that’s causing you stress. All the scary deadlines keeping you up at night. Until they’re physically written somewhere, these thoughts are heavy. In fact, they’re paralysing. The thought of starting one task and missing something we’re forgetting is terrifying. So before you start a single task, get clear on everything that needs to be done. Go crazy. Blurt it all down.
2. Specify, select and prioritise. The beautiful thing about having all your tasks in front of you is that you can then get clear on what needs to be done when. Scribble your deadlines next to tasks and rank them by urgency. A simple colour coding scheme is useful to help you get a handle on which tasks are most important. I like numbering them in order of importance. It’s tempting to be general when you know you have deadlines. Get specific with your tasks. Next, write down roughly how long each task will take you. Be as realistic as possible. As discussed in chapter 3 with timetabling, you will get better at estimating this with practice.
3. Slot your tasks into your timetable, schedule or calendar. The only way these things will get done is if you make time for them. Rather than stopping at the stage of identifying what you need to do, dare yourself to actually go do them. To-do lists are a whole trust exercise with yourself. Forget therapy – this is a free way to learn about how you commit to things.

### SAYING NO, MEANINGFULLY (FOCUS)
[[Dire non, de manière significative]]
Saying no is not about sacrificing enjoyment. It is not about rejecting spontaneity, which is beautiful and creates memorable experiences. Learning to say no is about saying yes to yourself. It is about honouring priorities you set for yourself in the past to benefit your future and sticking to them.

High-density fun only

Rather than making yourself feel better for rejecting social events in the pursuit of studying, commit to planning high-density fun.
Prioritise that movie night, that sports session and trying out that new recipe. You’re more likely to speed up the revision to go enjoy yourself.
Half-revising sucks. Match high-density revision with high-density fun!

### RECOMMENDED APPS (FORETHOUGHT, FOCUS AND FUN!)

Notion: I’ve mentioned it a few times because this desktop and phone app is my best friend. It has so many capabilities that it can feel initially overwhelming to learn how to use but when you do, it’s life changing. I use this for planning, journaling, brainstorming and ideation. I write my class notes and timetables in Notion too!
Forrest: this phone app is the best for productive study sessions!
Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique mentioned above, you can use your time spent studying to grow trees. If you touch your phone during the time set, your tree dies. I’m not sure there’s a better way to teach you to focus and commit. If you can turn revision into a fun game (and avoid murdering a tree), it feels less of a chore.
Todoist: if you love to-do lists but find yourself haphazardly writing them in the notes section of your phone, this app will help you keep track of tasks in a centralised way. You get motivational messages as you complete tasks and the interface is highly intuitive.
Any calendar app: I slot most of my events into my Google calendar. While I think bullet journals and paper planners are so special, the added benefit of reminder notifications is very useful. I especially love the flexibility of rearranging my day when events change.

- [[Rendez le amusant]]
```

We all have work to do. We all have exams to prepare for. But the good thing is, there are ways to make it easier to get all the things you don’t want to do done. This chapter will make you feel like homework is easy, or at least tolerable!

## ROUTINE, ROUTINE, ROUTINE
[[Créez des routines]]
The way to hack human psychology is to eliminate the feeling of choice. Rather than begging yourself every day to pick up your school planner, make it a pre-made arrangement by developing a routine.
The beauty of routine is that it becomes automatic. You can train yourself to put your phone away and start making a to-do list.
Any routine is grounded in habits. To develop it takes hard commitment and discipline until it feels easy. I often relapsed into going on my phone straight after school, only to scramble to finish my work late at night. Every time you break routine, you’re dishonouring the progress Past You made.

the most fundamental hack of all: snacks

No matter how tired or unmotivated I felt, I’d put my phone away, sit down at my desk, pull out my school planner and Blurt down everything I knew I had to do. Cue my ‘to-do list’ process from chapter 6. I wrote down everything

When I had all the tasks in front of me, I began to sort them by priority.

I would then jot down roughly how long each task would take me, being as specific as possible.

Then, without thinking, I’d allocate the next few hours to my tasks and slot the plan into my calendar.

Physically writing out tasks into a timed schedule makes you realise how realistic your to-do list is.

Selecting a reward early on is game-changing.

Perhaps you’ve heard of Parkinson’s Law. Work expands to fill the time you give it. Rather than giving myself the whole evening to complete something, slotting it into a calendar and having a clear goal that night was the motivation I needed.

## PROCRASTIN— OH LOOK, MY PHONE
[[Réduire votre procrastination]]
If you struggle to start working, make it a habit to complete one Pomodoro session every single day.

if you’re struggling to even begin your homework, this is a good place to start. Set a timer and commit to only focusing on one task for the duration. It takes so much more effort to start than it does to finish.

Sadly, the Distraction Free Zone is a myth. Anything can and will be a distraction if your brain wants it to be

## SANCTITY OF SPACE
[[Sanctification d'espace]]
This is the idea that every space in your living environment has a purpose.

Be disciplined in how you treat your space.

The more you teach your brain that a certain place means work, the less distracted you’ll be.

As hard as it may seem, the more disciplined you can be with yourself, the easier you’ll make your life. Be strict to be kind.

If your home environment isn’t optimal for work, develop Sanctity of Space in a location of your choice.

Sanctity takes effort but eventually reduces friction.

Wherever you decide to study, help your brain physically associate that space with work. You’ll be one step closer to making homework an easy habit!

## HERMIONE-GRANGER-LEVEL ORGANISATION
[[Développer une organisation digne d'Hermione Granger]]
Developing a system for where you keep your sheets or online files won’t turn you into Hermione. It also won’t mean you get your work done (sorry!).
But it’ll definitely make life easier.

If you prefer online files, you can develop a tree-like system of folders with clear titles.

If you are organising physical sheets, don’t be shy: get yourself a ring-binder folder.

Friction is one of the reasons we procrastinate. Organisation leviosaaa-s it away.

## MAKE IT FUN (?)
[[Rendez le amusant]]
While the most effective, deep work isn’t necessarily fun, it’s okay to be less efficient sometimes and enjoy yourself. For more passive homework, such as making a poster or taking notes, you have all the freedom in the world to create an experience.

Though I would have rather spent more time chatting with friends or chilling at home, I look back at my school days and know for certain that this habit-building taught me so much about discipline and hard work.

So, just like I made my forced bus journey every day a lively highlight, I’m sure you can make your forced homework a little less daunting. Or dare I say, fun?

# CHAPTER 8 HABIT FORMATION
```ad-note

- [[Qu'est-ce qu'une habitude]]
```

The secret is setting up positive habits that look after your mental health. I’m not talking about taking a self-care bubble bath once a month to cure your depression (let’s be honest, we love candles and face masks but they don’t solve everything!). Instead, I’m talking about habits which implement mindfulness into your life. Habits that can help you monitor and manage your stress levels without the promise of quick fixes. They require discipline and open-mindedness.

mental health is complex and more severe conditions cannot simply be cured with mindfulness. However, mindful practices have been proven beneficial for many reasons such as fighting stress.

## WHAT IS A HABIT?
[[Qu'est-ce qu'une habitude]]
habits are not as easy to set up as choosing to do something and simply doing it. However, it is essential to understand the process of habit creation if you are ever to improve your day-to-day life.

A habit is not just something you do every day.

Instead, habits are specific actions, often subconscious, that you find yourself doing in specific situations.

## HOW TO MAKE NEW HABITS STICK
[[Comment créer de nouvelles habitudes]]
The best way to have a consistent cue is to attach the desired habit onto an existing habit, one which may be subconscious.

Whatever it is, attach it to part of your daily routine.
That’s the only way it’ll stick.

In reality, grades are just an opportunity to see where you’re at. They’re the most useful indicator of what you do and don’t understand, allowing you to guide your learning and do better next time. From that point of view, failing more is good. It’s not about the grade you get along the way but rather how you react to and learn from it moving forwards.

Failure is a tool for growth, nothing more.

Learning is productive failure.

That’s all failure is. A chance to learn.

One of the biggest symptoms of fear of failure is perfectionism

There is too much friction in starting something if you know you want it to be perfect

Perfect is self-defined. You are reaching for the top rung of a ladder which is constantly getting higher because here’s the thing, you can always be more perfect.

Perfectionists have a better work rate and are more likely to set ambitious goals. We love goals.

perfection comes at a price. Where one goal stops, another starts. What begins as a healthy challenge ends in unhappiness because you can always challenge yourself more.

Perfection feels like you’re climbing a set of stairs to a defined goal destination. You’re lifting your heavy legs every step closer. The goal is in sight and so you keep walking, even when you’re exhausted. Rather than taking breaks on the staircase or stopping to admire the view, your eyes are fixed on the destination.
You keep trudging along.
But when you finally get there, a new set of stairs appears out of nowhere, enticing you higher.

when you eventually achieve what you want, the pride you feel is limited.

Ambition is plagued with a fear of never achieving ‘enough’.

Many people believe that their thoughts are caused by their feelings and emotions but, as this model shows, what we are experiencing physically also affects our thoughts.

If you must be a perfectionist, learn to be an adaptive perfectionist

The mark of a successful adaptive perfectionist is that they view their abilities as constantly growing and changing the more they learn. Set goals, have high standards for yourself, but don’t define yourself in them. Be preoccupied with growth, not failure.

## HOW TO COMBAT PERFECTIONISM
[[Combattre le perfectionnisme]]
Firstly, acknowledge that you experience it

it’s important to admit that to yourself

### The Pareto Principle – 80/20 Rule
[[Comment utiliser la loi de Pareto]]
80 per cent of your knowledge comes from 20 per cent of the total time you spend

The 80/20 rule suggests that 80 per cent of the product (grades) comes from 20 per cent of the input (revision).

The Pareto Principle invites you to identify the most meaningful elements of revision and prioritise them.

There is so much content to learn for every subject that memorising 100 per cent of all of it is no easy task

Imagine you’re revising for an end of chapter test tomorrow. What type of questions will be there? Are they weighted differently, such as a 2-mark and an 8-mark style question? Where are 80 per cent of the marks coming from? Is there an essay component worth more? Is there a type of maths question which garners more marks, such as the topic of integration or differentiation?
Analysing mark production is a way to game the system like a top student.

Start small and prioritise. If you’re aiming to smash the pass grade, focus your energy not on every tiny detail of the syllabus but rather exam technique and understanding big concepts

the trick is to identify what the most efficient output-producing activities are and optimise for them

what is the 20 per cent that leads to the 80 per cent? We can then use 80/20 thinking to change behaviour and to focus our attention on the 20 per cent that counts.

the 80/20 principle is a reminder that getting to 80 per cent is amazing, and it’s about optimising. The last 20 per cent is detail-orientated labour.

applying the 80/20 principle to the revision techniques which will get you there is a great start. It says, let me stop worrying about the perfect outcome and just systematically work towards most of my knowledge first.

### Consistency and resilience
[[Consistance et résilience]]
Not every day is going to be the best revision day of your life.

what happens if something throws you off track?

It’s tempting to abandon the whole thing.

When you’ve planned the rest of the day or you feel overwhelmed by the amount that needs to get done, you can feel a notion of failure in not meeting your own little deadlines.

Once again, perfect is the enemy of good.

It is far more powerful to revise frequently than for every study session to go as perfectly as planned.

You can learn to be agile, readjust your timetable and keep powering through. If you find a task more challenging than expected, note that down and keep trying.

Five average days of two-hour revision are better than one ‘perfect’ ten-hour session every two weeks.

the more resiliently you can show up and do the work, no matter how imperfect it feels, the more successful you will be.

Failure teaches you far more than success and for every disappointing percentage, there is an invitation to learn resilience, to remember that you are more than your grades, and to fall in love with the process.

you need to define what ‘enough’ is and make your standards of ‘good’ focused not on the final outcome but the process.

# CHAPTER 10 MENTAL HEALTH

- [[Qu'est ce que la santé mentale]]
- [[Discuter de sa santé mentale]]
```

Mental health, like the weather, is always there. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Sometimes easy, sometimes hard.

observation of your mental state is the first step to reacting accordingly.

It is a language only we can learn, expressed not in text or tongues. Becoming fluent feels like a scary, lonely, solo endeavour.

## WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?
[[Qu'est ce que la santé mentale]]
Mental health affects how you feel, think and act

Simply put, mental health means how well your mind is functioning overall.

it’s precarious. It’s affected by everything from stress to how much sleep you get, to the amount of blue light you receive through going on your phone.

There is no tick box or formula for achieving good mental health.
In fact, good mental health is not a fixed thing that you can ‘achieve’ and tick off your list. Instead, your mind fluctuates daily, like the weather, and that’s normal. Our mental state is often a reflection of how we react to daily life, such as how we handle stress and interact with others.

feeling persistently low starts to shape your overall mental wellbeing.

it’s important to recognise that mental health isn’t solvable by ‘choosing to be positive’. Nice try, motivational quotes.

The first step to coping with mental health – both yours and others’ – is to acknowledge its existence

We always do what we think is best but best is influenced by our fears.

One in four students in England will experience a mental health issue of some kind every year.

Exams are stressful

The academic system tricks you into thinking your worth is defined by a grade or an exam performance. This is a lie. Like Einstein said, you cannot judge everyone by a standardised system.
You have an entire personality and array of interests and talents that won’t be captured in these exams.

Start to see yourself in the broader context of life beyond this system.

exams do matter and they do determine the stepping stones of your future life. This is undeniably true. But it is important to remember that everything will still be okay. Whether you get glowing grades or no grades. Whether you get full marks or miss a grade by 1 per cent.

Do your revision but don’t attach yourself too greatly to the outcome. Focus on the learning and growth this period of your life is teaching you.

Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet: ‘There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.’^[ [[Shakespeare - quotes#^1]]]

Exams are just pieces of paper we give meaning to. Your brain is too clever and twists everything further than it needs to. Whatever that piece of paper holds, the world will not end.

## OPENING UP? NO, THANK YOU
[[Discuter de sa santé mentale]]
there is no level of stress you need to reach for your feelings to be valid enough to discuss.

Speaking to others halves the problem you have been magnifying in your own head.

Whether it’s diagnosed mental health issues or sustained periods of not feeling like your best self, it’s okay not to be okay.

The cyclical nature of academia that we all are conditioned into is something that is so easy to become invested in, to the extent where we see mental health and our emotional wellbeing as ‘after thoughts’.

# CHAPTER 11 THE NIGHT BEFORE AN EXAM
```ad-note

```
[[Vous préparer pour les examens]]
The night before an exam is less about the revision you do and more about how you set yourself up.

you now need to be well-rested, healthy and mentally prepared to tackle the challenges ahead.

This is why the night before an exam is a fine balance between last minute revision, and not allowing yourself to get stressed.

Nowadays we love quick-fix self-care instead of getting to the root of how we’re feeling. Are you eating well? Drinking enough water? Getting enough sleep?

You want the most optimal version of you in that exam hall. Start seeing your body as a tool, a weapon, a key to unlocking the best parts of your brain.

it’s not always easy to stay healthy during exam season but treating yourself as your priority will definitely make a difference.

Sleep is good. Actually, it’s bloody incredible. Feeling like you’re not going to collapse from exhaustion is heavily underrated.

We have a natural bias towards seeing more time spent revising as more effective once we get into the exam hall and discount the power of sleep or rest.
However, sleep is the time where information is processed and memories are solidified. Without a period of inactivity in your brain, anything you tried to learn will decay more quickly.

## STRATEGIC LAST-MINUTE REVISION
[[Révisions de dernière minute stratégiques]]
Ideally, the night before an exam is no longer about understanding.

You want to optimise time by using active recall SAAD revision techniques like blurting and flashcards. Most of all, start applying.

For peace of mind, consider making yourself a last-minute cheat sheet with all the niggling points you want to go over in the final moments. The process of making it is useful to pick out what you really don’t know and rereading it on the day gives you peace of mind.
Although, if you’re going to call it a ‘cheat sheet’ out loud, maybe be careful who’s around – you don’t want to start rumours . . . !

## CHECK, DOUBLE-CHECK AND TRIPLE-CHECK
[[Check, double check et triple check]]
Any element of the exam process which produces fear is an area to tackle. Is there anything more stressful than forgetting your calculator on the day of the science exam or waking up late thinking your exam is in the afternoon when it’s really in the morning?

Plan your wake-up alarm accordingly, know how you’re getting to the exam hall and identify all the resources you might need and make sure to pack your bag. Exams are stressful enough as it is. So be that boring over-cautious person who checks, double-checks and triple-checks the logistics.

Here’s an easy checklist to help you to prepare:
![[Examen - checklist]]
## STRUGGLING TO SLEEP?
[[Faites attention à votre sommeil]]
Be kind to yourself and stay away from the bubble.

have a proper bedtime wind-down

We all need a release during exam season and exercise of any kind will clear your head.

find a way to express how you’re feeling

The worst thing you can do is keep the fear bottled up, swimming around in your head with nowhere to go.

Sometimes you only realise how irrational your worries are when you put them on paper.

When you orient yourself into a space of gratitude, you cannot feel fear in the same way. The more deeply you write about what you’re grateful for, the more you’ll start to feel it. And in appreciating your life, even these tough moments, you’ll have the strength to face the exam tomorrow. After all, how lucky are you to have an education? We get the chance to not only learn but demonstrate our knowledge in a way that’s meaningful. Without all the unnecessary stress and hype, that’s pretty cool. Not everyone in the world gets to learn.

## THE MINDSET FOR SUCCESS

There is a branch of human memory called Hebbian learning. It’s pretty complex stuff, but the basic idea is that the more you think of something, the easier it is to think the same thing again.

We have lots of nerve cells in our brains which are responsible for creating and transmitting thoughts, and the more we use the same nerve cells, the more they start to work together. When you repeatedly use a certain pattern of thought, you are making it more accessible.

Your brain is so powerful, far more than we currently know.
Various academic literature in the space of neuroscience shows that self-affirmation has a high correlation with performance. If you repeatedly ask students to write about their closest values an hour before an exam, they will perform better.

When you think about doing well in an exam but feel in your heart that it won’t happen, you’re only halfway to the mindset you need.
Ideally, you need to work towards aligning your thoughts and feelings. The night before an exam, focus on directing your thoughts to a place of success. And then to go beyond just thinking: use all your imagination to feel what it would be like to succeed in this exam. Feel how proud you are. Feel how calmly you approach each question. Feel what it is like to keep working at a question methodically even if you don’t know the answer. Your emotional engagement with the upcoming exam will help prepare your mindset for success and reduce your likelihood of blanking.

The more strongly you can visualise the event in a positive way, the more likely you are to embody this visualisation when it comes to it.

## A TEST OF CHARACTER
[[Les examens sont un test de personnalité]]
Our modern exam system has become not merely a test of content or knowledge but also a test of character. They test your discipline and work ethic, but most of all, your ability to look after your mental health. Exams challenge you to deal with stress and try to be the best version of you, even when it seems hard.

The fact you made it to this day is a testament in itself. We love to believe we haven’t done enough, that we’re not ready.
Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, you will never be ready. You can only do your best in that exact moment with the resources you’ve been given and the questions which have been set.

Do your best. Look after yourself. Dare yourself to feel proud.

## THE MORNING BEFORE AN EXAM
[[Le matin d'un examen]]
the morning before is a love letter to your mindset. This is not the time to panic, nor beat yourself up for not trying harder. This is a time to get strategically calm.
Productively calm.

one of the facets of ‘MORNING’.
[[Le framework MORNING]]
M – Materials. As discussed in the last chapter, the evening before your exam, it is essential to pack the right tools, know the time of your exam on your schedule and the right room to be at.

O – Organise early. Wake up at least ten minutes earlier than you normally would. You don’t want to feel rushed. Eat a decent breakfast, drink water, pack your bag and soak up a chilled feeling of acceptance. We don’t like stress and an abundance of time minimises it.

R – Revise. But don’t cram. For peace of mind, look at some last-minute revision resources if it helps you get into the exam mindset.

N – No stress conversations. While supporting a friend the day of the exam is great and going over a last-minute concept with a teacher might be useful, conversations which spiral into fear are unproductive, or even harmful. Half of exam success is mindset.
You don’t need to hear how confident someone else feels or to listen to them describe in detail how difficult this paper will be.
Don’t feel guilty for stepping aside and waiting quietly.

I – Inhale, exhale. Whatever mindfulness means to you, focus on being present and calm. I recommend breathing techniques to quieten anxious thoughts and slow your heart rate. Positive visualisation techniques and affirmations are also a last-minute trick for success. As discussed in chapter 10, there are many scientific papers that indicate positive self-affirmation before an exam increases academic performance (and the reverse!). Rather than telling yourself why you’re not worthy of good grades, consciously hype yourself up.

N – Nice reward later. Visualise yourself after this exam, soaking up free time, hanging out with friends and being proud of yourself.
Get motivated by the prospect of smashing it out now.

G – Go for it! You’ve got this. Realise that you can only do your best in that moment, with the questions presented to you, with the revision you’ve done and with however you feel that day. The acceptance that comes knowing that and trying your best, makes results less important.

Every day that you have an exam, go through the MORNING list to yourself again. Materials? Check. Organised and ready to go early?
Yes. A bit of chilled Revision beforehand and definitely No stressed conversations. Inhale and breathe, centering yourself with the reminder of a Nice reward later that day. Finally, Go for it. Mindset, mindset, mindset. Believing in yourself is half the work.

## DURING AN EXAM
[[Durant l'examen]]
Exam success hinges on three main variables:
- Time - Knowledge - Mindset

How you attend to these three variables indicates how successful you will be.
Your success in the domain of **knowledge** depends on how efficient your revision has been; **time** and **mindset** are the keys to accessing this knowledge within the exam situation in a way that gets you the marks you want.

### Time

This is your constraint.

you don’t get infinite time.
Some subjects are especially time-constrained.

With such limited time, be harsh with yourself. Memorise the allocated time you should spend on each section of the paper. Know where you should be at half time. Calculate the exact time you need to switch to the next question.

most crucially, be harsher than you need to be. If you know you only have 45 minutes to write an essay, give yourself 40 minutes.

The act of feeling more time-pressured than you are will make you more efficient and crucially leave you time to check through and revise your answers or reattempt questions.

While focusing on the questions, have a constant awareness of where time is at. As soon as you enter the room, find the clock and get familiar with it. Equally, check if you’re allowed to bring a watch into the exam hall. If so, lucky you! The ability to track time on your wrist at a glance away will help you prioritise.
Make it a habit to regularly check in with the clock. Don’t let it induce stress. Think of the clock as your friend, encouraging you to use your seconds like gifts.

### Mindset

Mindset works in a feedback loop with posture, body language and sense of self-belief.

There is an art to faking confidence: dare yourself to stand up straight as you walk into the exam hall. Settle yourself into the chair like it’s a comfortable throne. Revel in slowly taking out your pen, locating and admiring the clock on the wall and finding humour in how well-orchestrated the exam environment is. This entire show was put on for you. That invigilator there? They’re technically here for you. How flattering. The effort to make the room silent? Again, all for you to optimise focus. How kind.

The more you can paint fun stories over what exams are, the easier it is to be confident within them.

What story will you tell yourself about the exam hall?

you’ve got to find your flow.

It’s being told the time is up and looking up from your exam paper as though remembering for the first time where you are. How strange that a piece of paper can prompt such deep thought and fast processing.

Finding the flow is about attention span and practice.

The more practice exam papers you finish without distractions or breaks, the better you become at finding and committing to the flow.

Flow can be trainesd through engaging in more frequent deep-processing exercises and using fewer tools which train a short-attention span, like social media. As discussed in previous chapters, you can develop a longer attention span.

Sometimes the front of the exam paper is transparent enough to make out the keywords of the first question on the next page. When you’re writing your name on the front page, lightly press down and you might be able to read the first question ahead of time.

#### Scribble your heart out – no one’s judging

Take advantage of your scrap paper or the edges of the exam sheet that you can use for pencil workings you can then rub out. When using revision techniques like making anagrams, using images as knowledge prompts or associating knowledge to objects, little drawings were essential to my recall.

#### Help – I don’t get the question*

Remember, time is one of the most important variables to consider during an exam. Through practice, you start to recognise if a question is within reach but taking longer than you thought or if you’re just wasting time.

Develop a system of putting a star next to a question you need to come back to. Then keep working through the paper. The idea is that you can collect marks on questions you are confident in and leave these problem questions for later.

If you’re feeling stuck, use your background knowledge to help bring context to a question which seems foreign. Always ground vague questions in foundations you do know.

## AFTER AN EXAM
[[Après un examen]]
you should reward yourself after hard work. Whether the exam felt like it went well or not, you did your best.

People often aren’t comforted by the idea of ‘doing your best’ because in their opinion, your best can always be better.

But that’s not the point of the phrase. The idea is not to reach a new personal best. It is to simply put your greatest effort into the given questions, at that moment, however you feel that day. That is your best. Your best given the exact circumstances of that moment.

So be proud. Hold your head high as you leave the exam hall, even if you struggled or froze. Stop overthinking the questions you think you should’ve known or second-guessing your answers.

focus on what you have just achieved.

You’re just a young person going through some of the hardest moments of your life – emotionally, physically and in terms of personal growth.

No one can downplay that what you just did was brave.

### Top three BEST things to do after an exam

1. Twitter. Never again in your life will you have the joy of exam memes specific to that exam.

2. Anything mind-numbing. You know those shows that don’t require you to think? The ones you can turn on and they make you dissolve away? Those are everything after an exam.

3. Write in a journal. Though reflecting on your exam might sound like your worst nightmare, running through your thoughts is calming. If you are beating yourself up about what you could’ve done better, expressing your thoughts helps you rationalise them.

### What if the exam didn’t go well?

it happens.

There will be bad exams. There will be bad papers. There will be moments you stare yourself in the face and feel like all hope for your future is fading before your eyes.
But maybe that’s the point of it all, this whole exam system. It teaches you to be resilient. I had to learn the hard way not to define my self-worth in the results of that paper. At the end of the day, I did my best. Not my best performance, but my best effort under that time-pressure and those mean questions.

Give yourself an allotted time to feel sorry for yourself. Get it out of your system. Dedicate yourself to processing however stressed you feel rather than suppressing your feelings and moving straight onto revision for the next exam.

And then move on. Recentre yourself. Remind yourself of what you’re grateful for, that you’re brilliant and that you’re also just human.
Rather than running over every question again in your head, bring your focus to the next subject or exam.

## THE NEXT EXAM

draw your attention to whatever’s next. To reduce friction to getting started, I recommend laying out the revision resources you need on your desk or bed beforehand so it feels easier to pick up when you’re tired!
Once again, strategise. Don’t waste time rereading or highlighting.
Return to the section on revision techniques for a refresher on how to make your revision SAAD and effective.
Optimise timetabling to ensure you can cover everything you want to before the next exam.
By this point, you’re a pro. Keep going. You’ve got this.

## FINISHED?

Or maybe that was your last exam? CONGRATULATIONS!
I am writing these words from a little library in Seoul, South Korea and I am infusing these lines with imaginary confetti. All the people silently working in this library don’t even realise they’re at an impromptu party. Imagine celebrations raining from the pages. You deserve it.

Exam season is a marathon and after marathons you deserve rest. And snacks. And a whole bloody holiday in the Maldives. All that revision and hard work paid off, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet. Go celebrate!

[[Qu'en est-il du futur]]
It seems only natural to finish with a chapter about what happens when this is all over. School is temporary. That stack of flashcards on your desk won’t always be there (unless it’s just that aesthetic). You won’t always have revision to do. There won’t be notes to make every day. End of chapter tests won’t be sprung on you every month of later life.

## DEFINE YOUR VALUES

The concept of one dream job is a directive of a past in which adults assumed one position in one company for most of their working life. We live in a very different world now, in which careers shift, roles are more fluid and working culture is dynamic, especially with the influence of technology.

The question of who you want to be when you’re older should not be about your means of making money. You are going to be a full, incredible person defined by the colours of your personality, the relationships you cultivate and your approach to life – no matter what your future occupation.

What are the values that make up you as a person? What features of your working life will make you feel fulfilled?

Job satisfaction is not necessarily about the amount you earn, nor how cool it looks on your LinkedIn profile. Instead, it’s about knowing yourself as a person and the kind of impact you want to have in the world.

The world is dynamic and shifting. The more you can hone your skillset in whatever you love, while cultivating your values, the better equipped you will be to find a job that fulfils you.

## YOU’RE ABOUT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE: ODYSSEY PLANS

This technique, developed from the Design Your Life course at Stanford University, was presented to me in my first year of university. ==It is a framework for viewing your life as abundant. It invites you to treat your life as something under your control – you are the ‘designer’.==

You will envision your life in three ways under different criteria.
Detail everything you can about how you see your life – from your day-to-day work, the country you’re living in, relationships and interests. Be bold, big and clear.
1) **Write down what your life will look like in five years if you continue on the path you’re on right now.** Even if that path seems hazy, extrapolate what you are currently studying or thinking about.
2) **Write down what your life will look in five years if you choose a different, but realistic alternative path.** This could be one you have thought about but do not think is feasible, for whatever reason.
3) **Write down what your life will look like in five years if money and outside expectations of you didn’t matter.** This could be anything. Get wild. Get crazy.

This process is really important because ==it’s guaranteed to make you view yourself as less trapped in your current reality==. It shows you that ==there are always other options, even when it doesn’t feel like it.== The final prompt is especially powerful in showing you what you really want to be doing: ==can any parts of this come true in your actual life?==
Sometimes wild ideas are the best at allowing you to question yourself and your current path.

Remember, the more you study and work hard now, the more options you are giving Future You!

## REACH FOR THE SKIES – EVEN IF THE SKIES REJECT YOU

As we get closer to finishing school, we need to think about our lives through an admittedly realistic lens, but also a bold one.
Applying for universities and jobs is already terrifying; the danger is we can trick ourselves into choosing what feels easier, or safer. We look at our past and who we are and try to fit ourselves like a puzzle piece into somewhere we see a close fit. The idea of aiming higher than what is immediately in front of us requires imagination and resilience, which is difficult to find without robust support systems.

I want you to think big and view yourself as worthy of fighting for the places you want to go when all this studying is done.
If the people around you ask you to shrink into easily achievable spaces, I implore you to challenge them.

No matter how much revision you do, no matter what your grades are, and no matter what your friends, teachers, parents or family think of you – you will always be enough.
Success means being proud of yourself for doing your best. So, I wish you success. I wish you all of it. I wish that you can look yourself in the mirror and pat yourself on the back no matter what that piece of paper says on results day. I wish you the success of feeling like you’re enough. Because you are.

# GLOSSARY

80/20 Principle: The idea that 80% of the final output comes from only 20% of the input. Identify which parts of your study habits generate the most benefit to your grades and optimise for them!
Active Recall: Rather than passively reading information in front of you, active recall means pulling knowledge from your memory when prompted. For example, answering questions without your notes or summarising something from memory. ^80-20

Association: Making connections between new things that you are learning and your existing knowledge. For example, finding similarities between words in a new language and yours. ^association

Blurting: A highly effective revision technique where you ‘blurt’ down on paper everything you can remember from a subject or topic from memory. Write yourself prompt words if necessary. ^blurting

Desirable Difficulty: This means making your revision progressively harder to test your knowledge. Focus on areas which are more difficult rather than covering what you already know. ^desirableDifficulty

Fixed Mindset: The idea that our abilities and intelligence cannot be changed, such as believing that you are ‘naturally not good at maths’. ^fixedMindset

Growth Mindset: The idea that our abilities change with time and work, such as believing that you don’t understand a maths question yet but you can and you will with enough practice. This mindset is useful to approach mistakes as a point of learning. ^growthMindset

MARCKS: A useful acronym to learn from the mistakes you made on past papers to guide your future revision. Count the number of times you lost a mark because of each of these! (Maths error, Application, Read the question, Communication, Knowledge and Statements). ^MARCKS

Mark scheme: This document contains the answers to a past paper and is used to mark your work. They are amazing tools to learn from because they tell you how to word your answers, why you’ve gone wrong and what the exam boards are looking for! ^marckScheme

Pomodoro Technique: Set a 25-minute timer and focus on only one task. Then reward yourself with a 5-minute break. This is a useful technique to help structure your time, beat procrastination and enhance deep focus. ^Pomodoro

Spaced Repetition: To combat the way that humans naturally forget information over time, spaced repetition means reviewing information at slowly increasing intervals to boost your memory back up to 100%. For example, going over a flashcard set on Day 1, Day 3 and Day 6 after first learning it. ^spacedRepetition

Specification: A document created for every subject by your exam board which lists all the things you need to know for the exam. This is very useful to guide your revision! ^specification

The Fudge Ratio: This useful calculation helps you make better estimates for how long tasks take you. Simply divide how long a task took you by how long you thought it would take. From now on, multiply your estimates by this number for more accurate planning and timetables! ^fudgeRatio
