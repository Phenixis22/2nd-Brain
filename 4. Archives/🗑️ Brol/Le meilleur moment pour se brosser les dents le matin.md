Une question venant du [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/well/live/brushing-teeth-breakfast.html?unlocked_article_code=E5WxndBIA7b-cB0Ly0vA02xdy83cn3dgRnYnOkGm6YC1ysWvsrim9qKaHYQHHluKcORFgArOm5cUwtprw_yxtldXYo16-QAGNrfiMlHjV2BGh76OiZoiIBcPcSJTYj5xCu7T9HJJ1lSS8haYs44E-MW_WnSkPEf6FVEZGXB-U4CNThu8N9yS8eax7gG4OQABOsNMtCBgrOeJskf_sdYYcQ0CNOzBE-nVx-FRfHIHRKpgZyzLqyTd365iOC8J8vuSgtIynqgDXqdcDXF_cokCzm9MIMk_jT7wT7BMh8QBu6izE_5sVL9v3FWb_PnhYpHDgn1QyYAcc1C0f971mjVM4l1Dfe4&smid=share-url) : "Est-ce mieux de se brosser les dents avant ou après le petit-déjeuner ?" Voici un résumé de l'article :

The truth is that few studies have looked into this question and their results have been mixed and limited, so there isn’t a definitive answer, said Dr. Apoena de Aguiar Ribeiro, a pediatric dentist and microbiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But, she and other dentists said, there are pros and cons for each option to keep in mind.
# The case for brushing before breakfast
For many people, <mark class="hltr-default">breakfast includes sugary carbohydrates that bacteria love to feed on</mark>. Then, <mark class="hltr-default">when you wake up in the morning, bacterial levels in your mouth are at their peak</mark> — “that’s why we have bad breath when we wake up.”

So <mark class="hltr-default">a mouth rife with bacteria and a breakfast full of sugary carbs means that conditions are perfect for the bacteria to flourish and multiply</mark>. When this happens, <mark class="hltr-default">they release acids that can wear down the protective enamel</mark> on your teeth, <mark class="hltr-default">making them more prone to cavities</mark>. <mark class="hltr-default">Brushing before breakfast clears that bacteria away</mark>, denying them the opportunity to feed on your food.

Another reason to brush before breakfast is to jump-start the production of saliva, which is one of the most protective forces for your teeth. Saliva helps strengthen your teeth by depositing minerals that bacteria may have eaten away overnight. It also contains bicarbonate that helps to neutralize the acidity in your mouth. An added bonus, is that if your toothpaste contains fluoride is that if your toothpaste contains fluoride, it will make your teeth more resistant to decay by strengthening your enamel and neutralizing the acids from breakfast.

Another reason to integrate brushing into your “getting up” routine is to prevent the possibility that you will run out of time or forget to do it later. 
# The case for brushing after breakfast
Even if you brush right before breakfast, you probably will still have bacteria lingering in your mouth that could multiply and produce acids during breakfast and for the rest of the day, so you may as well brush after you eat to minimize that lingering food. The fluoride from your toothpaste will work better throughout the day if it is not displaced by chewing food right after you brush.

Some experts argue that brushing your teeth too soon after a meal, especially one with acidic beverages, will damage your enamel. That is true but the actual damage that could be done would be so minimal that it wouldn’t really affect the health of your teeth. So the benefits of post-breakfast brushing outweigh the potential negatives.

if you can, wait at least [30 minutes](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/brushing-immediately-after-meals-you-may-want-wait#:~:text=Waiting%20about%2030%20minutes%20before%20brushing%20allows%20tooth%20enamel%20to%20remineralize%20and%20build%20itself%20back%20up.) after a meal to brush. If you want to get rid of lingering breakfast bits before then, she suggested drinking or swishing water.

# The bottom line
Ultimately, the decision boils down to what works for you because the science is sparse. There is no proof either way so all of the arguments are largely theoretical. 

The most important question to ask yourself is this: What brushing habit will make me most likely to brush my teeth consistently? Once you have your answer work it into your routine and stick with it.
