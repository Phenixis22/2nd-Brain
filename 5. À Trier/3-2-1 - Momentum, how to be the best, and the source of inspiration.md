title: "Momentum goes both ways.</br> </br> Don’t move, feel sluggish. Start moving, feel like moving a little more.</br> </br> Don't talk, feel timid. Start chatting, conversation gets a little easier.</br> </br> Don't ship, feel stuck. Start creating, ideas begin to flow."<br>*- **James Clear** *

## II.
```ad-quote
title: "Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous I don't know."<br>*- **Wislawa Szymborska**, Poet, from <u>The Poet and the World </u>*
