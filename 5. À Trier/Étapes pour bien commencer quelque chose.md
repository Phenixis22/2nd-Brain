General Example : Making a Youtube Channel.
# *Part 1 → Get Going**

During this level, you want to publish your first 3 videos.

You shouldn’t worry about your niche, the quality of your videos, or any other technicality that could stop you from publishing.

The #1 reason why people never start a YouTube channel is that they’re too afraid to publish their first video. After that’s out of the equation, you’re one (huge) step closer to having a successful YouTube channel.

Think about these first three videos as the first three dates.

You want to test if you like the other person and if after these 3 dates, you want to meet each other more often and turn it into something serious.

After all, **YouTube is a lifestyle choice**. You’re choosing to make weekly videos for the rest of your life.

Now comes the first choice.

## **Choice #1 → Casual or Serious Relationship**

Just like after the first three dates you have to either commit or give up.

If you found that making these 3 videos was fun and you can see yourself making such weekly videos for the next year or two then you can move on to part two.

# **Part 2 → Get Good (Enough)**

In this phase, you want to publish your next 7 videos.

This is where you consciously improve your YouTube-related skills.

At first glance, YouTube is very simple. Hit record, say your bit, edit, and publish.

In reality, in order to make it on YouTube, you have to get good at:

-   titles
-   writing
-   editing
-   filming
-   research
-   animation
-   thumbnails
-   storytelling
-   public speaking
-   structuring videos
-   talking to a camera
-   understanding analytics

Try to improve each of these skills while making your next 7 videos.

Again, don’t worry about your niche, just make sure you learn new skills and get familiar with the craft of making YouTube videos.

Going back to the analogy of the relationship, this is when we’re learning more about the other person.

With these 10 videos that you’ll now have published, you’ll a) be much better at making YouTube videos and b) you’ll have likely confronted the most common emotions like the fear of getting judged or self-doubt.

This is going to help you make the second choice…

## **Choice #2 → YouTube as a Hobby or Business**

With 10 videos on your channel, you’ll either want to continue publishing regular, weekly videos but you may also want to publish videos from time to time but with no expectations of results. Both are fine. But you have to decide.

If on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘I just want to have fun’ and 10 is ‘I want to see results’, you’re close to a 10 then you want to treat YouTube as a business.

# **This is when we move on to Part 3 → Get Smart**.

Here, we want to understand the game of YouTube.

So far, you were casually making videos, trying to gradually improve your skills.

Now, you need to understand what YouTube cares about when it comes to growing a YouTube channel.
